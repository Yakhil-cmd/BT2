No vulnerability found for this question.

**Reasoning:** `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) is a simple `if`/`is-eq` dispatcher that routes to one of six vault contracts based on `aid` — it contains no `fold`, no list, and no bound that could be "pushed past." [1](#0-0) 

There is no fold-bound mechanism in this function for an attacker to exceed, so the premise of the question ("push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts") does not correspond to any code path actually reachable through `liquidate`. `liquidate` itself is a permissionless, intentionally public function that anyone may call against any borrower's underwater position — this is the protocol's designed liquidation mechanism, not a defect, and the rules explicitly reject "a liquidator earning the configured penalty" as in-scope. No shared state write by an attacker A that corrupts a distinct victim B's position through this specific `vault-system-repay` routing logic was identified. [2](#0-1)
