Confirmed: `ERC20Matcher` (`IsLocalAccountKey20` / `AccountKey20ToH160`) matches **any** local `AccountKey20` location as a valid ERC20 asset id, with no allow-list or "trusted asset" gating [1](#0-0) . Any user can permissionlessly deploy an arbitrary Solidity contract via `pallet_revive` and use it as an XCM asset through `ERC20Transactor`.

### Title
XCM `ERC20Transactor` credits/moves the nominal `amount` instead of the actual ERC20 balance delta, breaking accounting for fee-on-transfer/deflationary ERC20 tokens - ([File: cumulus/parachains/runtimes/assets/common/src/erc20_transactor.rs])

### Summary
`ERC20Transactor::withdraw_asset_with_surplus` and `deposit_asset_with_surplus` call an arbitrary user-deployed ERC20 contract's `transfer` function and, as long as it returns `true`, unconditionally treat the *requested* `amount` as the amount that moved, without verifying the real balance change of the checking account or beneficiary [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) . This is exactly the bug class in the referenced report: crediting the nominal transferred amount rather than the actually-received amount, applied to any ERC20 contract that charges a fee-on-transfer (a fully legal, standard-compliant ERC20 pattern that still returns `true`).

### Finding Description
`withdraw_asset_with_surplus` calls `IERC20::transferCall{to: checking_address, value: amount}` from the user's account to the shared `ERC20TransfersCheckingAccount`. If the call succeeds (`transferCall` returns `true`), the code creates `Erc20Credit(amount)` — the *nominal* requested amount — and inserts it into the XCM holding register:
```
if is_success {
    Ok((AssetsInHolding::new_from_fungible_credit(what.id.clone(), Box::new(Erc20Credit(amount))), surplus))
}
``` [4](#0-3) 
There is no `balanceOf(checking_address)` check before/after the call, unlike the balance-before/after pattern the original report recommends. If the ERC20 contract charges a transfer fee (e.g., burns or redirects a percentage on every `transfer`), the checking account's real balance increases by less than `amount`, yet the XCM engine now believes it holds the full `amount`.

Symmetrically, `deposit_asset_with_surplus` transfers the nominal `amount` out of the shared checking account to the beneficiary and returns success on any non-reverted `true` result, again without checking the beneficiary's real balance delta [5](#0-4) .

Because `ERC20TransfersCheckingAccount` is a single shared pooled account used for *all* ERC20 assets/users passing through this transactor [6](#0-5) , a fee-on-transfer token creates a persistent mismatch between the checking account's true on-chain ERC20 balance and the sum of nominal credits recorded across independent XCM programs. This is a real "unbacked issuance" style bug at the XCM-holding layer: nominal credits can exceed actual backing in the shared checking account, so whichever depositor executes their `DepositAsset` first drains real tokens that nominally "belong" to a different depositor's still-unspent withdrawal, ultimately causing the disadvantaged user's own `deposit`/`transfer` to revert (`FailedToTransactAsset("ERC20 contract transfer failed")`) once the checking account is insufficiently funded to cover the aggregate nominal amounts recorded for it.

### Impact Explanation
This causes deterministic loss/freezing of value for unprivileged users transacting through `ERC20Transactor` with any ERC20 contract that implements a transfer fee — a completely standard and permitted ERC20 behavior, not any kind of malicious contract exploit or reentrancy. Because `ERC20TransfersCheckingAccount` pools balances across all users of the same token, one user's withdrawal being processed first can consume real balance nominally owed to another user's not-yet-processed deposit, leading to failed transfers/reverts and functional loss of the "phantom" difference for at least one party. This matches Medium severity in the referenced report's own classification — an accounting/availability bug for tokens with fee-like transfer semantics that the protocol does not yet officially support but which is fully reachable today through permissionless contract deployment and the un-gated `ERC20Matcher`.

### Likelihood Explanation
Likelihood is high in principle since: (1) anyone can deploy a fee-on-transfer ERC20 contract via `pallet_revive`, no privilege required; (2) `ERC20Matcher` accepts any local `AccountKey20` location without an allow-list [1](#0-0) ; (3) `pallet_xcm::Pallet::execute` is callable by any signed origin, as demonstrated by existing tests exercising `withdraw_and_deposit_erc20s` with this exact transactor [7](#0-6) . However, exploitation for cross-user value theft requires timing/ordering across multiple XCM executions sharing the same checking account for the same fee-on-transfer token, which I was not able to construct and run as a concrete, deterministic PoC within this investigation.

### Recommendation
In `withdraw_asset_with_surplus` and `deposit_asset_with_surplus`, read `balanceOf` of the checking account/beneficiary before and after the `transferCall`, and use the actual observed delta (not the nominal `amount`) both for the `Erc20Credit` inserted into the XCM holding register and for determining success/failure, mirroring the balance-before/balance-after pattern recommended in the referenced report.

### Proof of Concept
I was unable to execute an actual PoC against the codebase — this analysis is based purely on static code review of `erc20_transactor.rs`, `xcm_config.rs`, and matching/type definitions in `assets-common`. The core defect (crediting nominal `amount` instead of measured balance delta) is directly visible in the cited code and is structurally analogous to the reported issue, but I did not run a live integration test demonstrating the cross-user fund-shortfall scenario described above; that would require deploying a custom fee-on-transfer ERC20 fixture and orchestrating two competing XCM executions through the shared `ERC20TransfersCheckingAccount`, which is beyond what I could verify with read-only code inspection.
