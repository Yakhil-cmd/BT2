### Title
Untrusted swap routes can execute arbitrary venue code that steals unrelated caller tokens through the signed authorization tree - ([File: contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs](contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs))

### Summary

The controller accepts caller-supplied route bytes and invokes the configured router inside strategy entrypoints such as `swap_collateral`, `swap_debt`, `multiply`, and `repay_debt_with_collateral`. A malicious route can place attacker-controlled venue code on the call stack. That code can invoke `token.transfer(caller, attacker, amount)` for an unrelated wallet token; Soroban simulation records the call as a child of the caller’s strategy authorization. If the resulting authorization tree is signed, the unrelated transfer executes. The controller’s exact input-transfer authorization and measured output checks do not bound this separate caller-authorized transfer.

### Finding Description

The external issue’s relevant bug class is attacker-controlled configuration causing execution of attacker-controlled commands. Its Soroban analog is the strategy route payload: route bytes determine which venue contract the router invokes, while the caller signs the enclosing authorization tree.

`swap_collateral` authenticates the caller and account authority, then passes the user-controlled `swap` bytes into `withdraw_and_swap_from_supply`. [1](#0-0) 

The controller’s router wrapper authorizes only one token transfer—from the controller to the configured router for the exact routed input—and then calls `router.execute_strategy` while measuring controller balances. [2](#0-1)  Those checks reject controller input overspend and require positive measured output, but they do not constrain child invocations that a route-selected contract makes under the caller’s authorization. [3](#0-2) 

The repository’s threat-model documentation explicitly states that route-selected third-party code can run below the caller’s authorization and can cause a caller token transfer to be recorded as a child authorization. [4](#0-3)  A regression test demonstrates that a route-named contract can call `token.transfer(victim, attacker, amount)` and that simulation attaches that transfer beneath the caller’s `swap_collateral` authorization. [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) 

### Impact Explanation

This permits theft of unrelated wallet tokens held by the strategy caller. The malicious venue still pays enough legitimate output for the strategy to pass the controller’s measured-output and account-risk checks, while its nested transfer moves another token from the caller to the attacker. The demonstrated loss is the caller’s entire unrelated wallet-token balance while the protocol-facing swap output remains valid. [7](#0-6) 

The affected surface includes every controller strategy that accepts route bytes: `multiply`, `swap_debt`, `swap_collateral`, and `repay_debt_with_collateral`. [8](#0-7) 

### Likelihood Explanation

An attacker needs no protocol privilege or leaked key: they deploy or reference malicious route-compatible code and induce a strategy caller to use that route. The caller still must sign the transaction, but simulation embeds the malicious transfer in the authorization tree, so wallets or integrations that do not reject unexpected child authorizations authorize the theft. The test shows that an honest root-only authorization is rejected, while the simulated poisoned tree succeeds. [9](#0-8) 

Because routes are supplied as opaque bytes and venues are intentionally route-selected, unsigned client-side inspection is currently the boundary preventing the attack. That makes the issue exploitable through malicious quoting, UI compromise, copied routes, or integrations that sign simulated authorization trees without validating every child invocation.

### Recommendation

Constrain route execution to governance-approved venue contracts and token contracts, or change the authorization boundary so route-selected code cannot join the user’s authorization tree. At minimum, controller and router integrations should enforce an authorization-tree policy that permits only the expected strategy invocation and the single expected input transfer, and reject every additional child invocation before signing. Route-byte verification alone is insufficient because opaque XDR does not reliably show the signing consequences of nested calls.

### Proof of Concept

1. Alice owns a debt-free lending account with supplied USDC and separately holds an unrelated wallet token.
2. An attacker deploys a venue contract whose swap entrypoint invokes `wallet_token.transfer(Alice, attacker, balance)`.
3. The attacker supplies a route that invokes that venue while still delivering the expected swap output.
4. Alice submits `swap_collateral(Alice, account_id, USDC, amount, ETH, route)`.
5. Simulation records the unrelated wallet-token transfer as a child of Alice’s controller authorization.
6. If Alice signs that returned tree, the rogue venue’s transfer executes and moves the unrelated tokens to the attacker.
7. The strategy still completes because the router output and account risk are valid.

The included harness proves each step: it deploys a route-selected rogue pool, records the stolen transfer beneath `swap_collateral`, demonstrates rejection without the child authorization, and demonstrates theft once the poisoned tree is signed. [10](#0-9)

```markdown
That bound covers the controller's own grant only. The router calls the pool
and token addresses its payload names and keeps no allowlist of them, so a
route can put third-party code on the call stack below the caller's
authorization. A token transfer that such code makes from the caller is
recorded by an honest simulation as a child of the caller's authorization
entry, and it executes if the caller signs that tree. The loss is then the
caller's wallet, not the routed amount, and neither the payload minimum nor the
final risk gate bounds it. An honest swap strategy gives the caller no child
entry, and a direct router swap gives exactly one input transfer. A client must
decode the route it signs and refuse an authorization tree with any other
child. The direct `execute_strategy` path has the same exposure for every swap
user.
