### Title
Interest accrual overflows `i128` and permanently freezes a market - ([File: common/src/rates/index.rs])

### Summary
A sufficiently large supplied and borrowed market can grow until `borrowed * borrow_index` or `supplied * supply_index` exceeds `i128`. Because every state-changing pool operation synchronizes the market before acting, the first crossing causes `MathOverflow` and leaves `last_timestamp` unchanged; later `withdraw`, `repay`, `liquidate`, `clean_bad_debt`, `recapitalize`, and `update_indexes` calls hit the same overflow. This permanently freezes the market absent a privileged code upgrade. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description
`synced_market` loads the market and calls `global_sync`; `run_batch`, `load_leg`, `recapitalize`, liquidation, and strategy paths all route through this synchronization or an equivalent accrual. [4](#0-3)  `global_sync` repeatedly calls `accrue_step`, which converts both aggregate scaled books to their original values before calculating utilization and rewards. [2](#0-1) [5](#0-4)  Those conversions multiply an aggregate `Ray` book by its index, while interest calculation separately multiplies `borrowed` by both the old and new borrow indexes; all results must remain within `i128`. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

Caps only ensure that the initial token-to-RAY conversion fits `i128`; they do not reserve headroom for index growth, whose ceiling is another `10^9` multiplier. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8)  An unprivileged caller can create an account with `supply`, borrow through `borrow`, and trigger accrual through the permissionless `update_indexes` entrypoint. [10](#0-9) [11](#0-10) 

### Impact Explanation
Once aggregate debt or supply value passes the representable `i128` range, the market cannot be synchronized, so suppliers cannot withdraw and borrowers cannot repay through normal controller calls. [12](#0-11) [13](#0-12)  The existing integration test demonstrates the reachable state and confirms that `update_indexes`, withdrawal, and repayment all return `MathOverflow`, while the borrow index remains below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [14](#0-13)  This is permanent freezing of user funds and can leave otherwise collectible debt and pool cash unreachable. [4](#0-3) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The attacker only needs an already listed market with enough supply/borrow headroom and collateral to establish a large, persistently utilized position; no privileged call, malicious token, oracle failure, or leaked key is required. [10](#0-9) [15](#0-14)  Reaching the boundary requires substantial value and index growth rather than a single immediate transaction, so the issue is appropriately rated Medium despite its permanent impact. [16](#0-15) 

### Recommendation
Constrain market books by the post-index value domain, not only by token-to-RAY input conversion. [8](#0-7)  Enforce a scaled-share ceiling such as `scaled <= i128::MAX / MAX_INDEX` for both supply and borrow usage, and validate governance caps against that bound. [17](#0-16)  Additionally, perform debt and supply valuation in a widened integer type during accrual and fail safely before an overflowing index is selected, so that a market approaching the boundary cannot become irreversibly unable to sync. [18](#0-17) [7](#0-6) 

### Proof of Concept
The repository already contains a concrete reproduction: it supplies one billion 18-decimal tokens, borrows 98% of that amount, advances accrual, and observes `MathOverflow`; subsequent withdrawal and repayment fail with the same error. [19](#0-18) 

```rust
// tests/test-harness/tests/controller/large_positions_and_long_horizons.rs
let principal = BILLION * 10i128.pow(18);
t.supply_raw(BOB, "BIG18", principal);
let debt = principal / 100 * 98;
t.supply_raw(ALICE, "COL", BILLION * 10_000_000 * 3);
t.borrow_raw(ALICE, "BIG18", debt);

// After enough accrued index growth:
assert_contract_error(t.try_update_indexes_for(&["BIG18"]), errors::MATH_OVERFLOW);
assert_contract_error(t.try_withdraw_raw(BOB, "BIG18", 1), errors::MATH_OVERFLOW);
assert_contract_error(t.try_repay(ALICE, "BIG18", 1.0), errors::MATH_OVERFLOW);
```

```markdown
A cap is in native token units. Entry compares stored scaled usage plus the
new scaled amount with the cap floor-converted at the current index. Zero cap
allows no positive exposure. Exits subtract usage without checking caps;
missing usage rows and zero exit deltas are no-ops. Cap→scaled conversion
saturates at `i128::MAX` (`calculate_scaled_cap`), so the entry check fails
open instead of trapping. A saturated scaled cap does not enforce the
configured asset-unit limit. An admitted cap saturates only at an index below
one RAY. Only a bad-debt write-down moves the supply index below one RAY; at
its floor (`RAY / 1000`), a supply cap above 1/1000 of the admitted maximum
saturates. The borrow index never falls below one RAY, so an admitted borrow
cap cannot saturate. Position conversion still rejects overflow.
```

| Bound | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
