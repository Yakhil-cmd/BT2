### Title
Unconstrained swap routes can attach arbitrary wallet-draining token transfers to a user-signed authorization tree - (File: contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs)

### Summary

A malicious route venue can execute under the user’s `swap_collateral` authorization and request an unrelated `token.transfer` from that user to an attacker; if the user signs the simulated authorization tree, the unrelated wallet tokens are transferred even though the lending swap itself remains valid. [1](#0-0) 

### Finding Description

`swap_collateral` authenticates only `caller` and verifies that the caller owns or delegates the target account before withdrawing collateral and invoking the configured router. [2](#0-1)  The controller authorizes exactly one input-token transfer from itself to the router and then executes the caller-supplied route, but it does not constrain which third-party contracts that route can invoke. [3](#0-2)  Afterward, it only checks that the controller did not overspend the routed input and that it received positive output; these checks do not prevent route code from requesting additional authorization from the original caller. [4](#0-3) 

A route can therefore name an attacker-controlled venue that calls `token.transfer(victim, attacker, amount)` for a token unrelated to the lending swap. [5](#0-4)  Transaction simulation records that transfer as a child invocation beneath the victim’s signed `swap_collateral` authorization; if the victim signs that returned tree, the host accepts the child transfer. [6](#0-5) 

### Impact Explanation

The attacker can steal arbitrary unrelated tokens held in the victim’s wallet, not merely the collateral committed to the swap. [1](#0-0)  The protocol’s measured-output and final-account-risk checks do not bound this loss because the malicious transfer uses the victim’s own signed authorization rather than protocol funds. [4](#0-3) 

### Likelihood Explanation

Exploitation requires the victim to execute a malicious route and sign the poisoned authorization tree returned by simulation. [7](#0-6)  An attacker can deploy the malicious venue without privileges and distribute the route bytes to a prospective `swap_collateral` user; clients that do not reject unexpected child invocations expose their users to the theft. [8](#0-7) 

### Recommendation

Restrict route hops to governance-approved or otherwise allowlisted venue contracts before executing user-supplied routes. Clients must also decode simulated authorization trees and reject any invocation other than the expected router input pull; however, client validation should not be the only defense because the production route boundary currently permits arbitrary third-party code beneath the caller’s authorization. [1](#0-0) 

### Proof of Concept

1. The attacker deploys a venue contract whose `swap` function calls `token.transfer(victim, attacker, victim_wallet_balance)` on a token that need not be listed by the lending protocol. [5](#0-4) 
2. The victim calls `controller.swap_collateral(caller = victim, account_id = victim_account, current = USDC_market, amount = 5_000_USDC, new = ETH_market, swap = route_containing_malicious_venue)`. [9](#0-8) 
3. The controller authorizes only the expected `USDC.transfer(controller -> router, 5_000_USDC)`, invokes the route, and accepts the swap if the controller receives positive ETH output. [10](#0-9) 
4. During route execution, the malicious venue requests `unrelated_token.transfer(victim -> attacker, victim_wallet_balance)`; simulation nests that request beneath the victim’s `swap_collateral` authorization. [11](#0-10) 
5. If the victim signs the returned tree, the unrelated token transfer succeeds while the collateral swap also completes normally. [12](#0-11)

That bound covers the controller's own grant only. The router calls the pool
and token addresses its payload names and keeps no allowlist of them, so a
route can put third-party code on the call stack below the caller's
authorization. A token transfer that such code makes from the caller is
recorded by an honest simulation as a child of the caller's authorization
entry, and it executes if the caller signs that tree. The loss is then the
caller's wallet, not the routed amount, and neither the payload minimum nor the
final risk gate bounds it. An honest swap strategy gives the caller no child
entry, and a direct router swap gives exactly one input transfer. A client must
decode the route it signs and refuse an authorization tree with any other
child. The direct `execute_strategy` path has the same exposure for every swap
