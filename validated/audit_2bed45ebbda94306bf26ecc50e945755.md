### Title
Accrued RAY value overflows `i128`, permanently freezing a market - (File: `contracts/pool/src/interest.rs`)

### Summary

A sufficiently large, highly utilized market can grow `borrowed * borrow_index` beyond the `i128` range before reaching the configured borrow-index cap, after which every operation that first synchronizes interest reverts and the market is permanently frozen. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description

Every state-changing market operation loads a synchronized cache through `synced_market`, which invokes `interest::global_sync` before processing the requested action. [2](#0-1)  `global_sync` repeatedly calls `accrue_chunk`, and the resulting interest calculation evaluates the total scaled debt value by multiplying `borrowed` by `borrow_index`. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4)  That multiplication uses overflow-safe fixed-point arithmetic, but an exact result above `i128::MAX` raises `MathOverflow` rather than saturating to the borrow-index cap. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6)  The borrow-index cap is applied only after the overflowing multiplication, so it cannot protect accrual once the total RAY-denominated debt value crosses the `i128` boundary. [8](#0-7) 

### Impact Explanation

Once this state is reached, `update_indexes`, `withdraw`, `repay`, `borrow`, liquidation-related settlement, and other market actions all perform accrual first and therefore revert before changing state. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)  Supplier principal and yield become permanently inaccessible, borrowers cannot repay, liquidators cannot reduce risk, and bad-debt cleanup or recapitalization cannot progress because they also require a synchronized market cache. [11](#0-10) [12](#0-11)  This is permanent freezing of user funds rather than a temporary pause or a bounded loss caused by ordinary liquidation. [3](#0-2) 

### Likelihood Explanation

An unprivileged attacker can create the prerequisite state through `Controller::supply(caller, account_id, spoke_id, assets)` and `Controller::borrow(caller, account_id, borrows, to)`, provided the market’s configured caps and token supply permit roughly the tested scale of exposure. [13](#0-12) [14](#0-13)  After sustained high utilization, the attacker or any third party triggers the overflow through `Controller::update_indexes` for that market, and subsequent attempts to repay or withdraw hit the same accrual panic. [15](#0-14)  The likelihood is bounded by the need for a very large supplied balance, sufficient collateral, high utilization, and market configuration that admits that exposure, but no privileged function is required for the freezing transition once those market conditions exist. [16](#0-15) 

### Recommendation

Bound the scaled debt value before multiplying by the next index, or compute the accrued increment with a saturating value calculation that caps both the index and effective debt value before `i128` overflow can occur. [8](#0-7) [5](#0-4)  Add an emergency path that can clamp an over-limit market without requiring normal accrual, while preserving conservative rounding and preventing the clamp from releasing unbacked withdrawals. [2](#0-1) [17](#0-16)  Enforce supply, borrow, and utilization caps tightly enough that `scaled_debt * MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` remains representable for every admitted market. [8](#0-7) [18](#0-17) 

### Proof of Concept

The repository’s directed test supplies one billion whole units of an 18-decimal asset, borrows 98% of it against separate collateral, advances ledger time until `update_indexes` fails, and confirms that both repayment and withdrawal subsequently revert with `MathOverflow`. [16](#0-15)  The decisive sequence is `supply(BIG18, 1_000_000_000 * 10^18)`, `supply(COL, sufficient collateral)`, `borrow(BIG18, 98% of principal)`, then repeated `update_indexes([BIG18])` until `scaled_to_original(borrowed, borrow_index)` overflows.

```markdown
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
