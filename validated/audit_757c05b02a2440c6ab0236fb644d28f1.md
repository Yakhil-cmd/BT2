### Title
Unrelated wallet-token transfers can be smuggled into a strategy authorization tree - (File: contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs)

### Summary
Controller strategy entrypoints accept a caller-controlled swap payload and invoke external route code while the account owner’s authorization is active. A malicious route can request a `token.transfer` from the account owner to an attacker; Soroban accepts that transfer when the transaction’s signed authorization tree contains it as a child of the strategy call. The controller’s balance-delta checks measure only the strategy’s expected input/output and do not bound unrelated calls performed under the owner’s authorization.

### Finding Description
`swap_collateral` is an externally reachable owner/delegate entrypoint that forwards the caller-supplied `swap` bytes into strategy execution. [1](#0-0)  Strategy authorization authenticates the supplied `caller` and rejects only flash-loan reentrancy; it does not create a separate security boundary for subsequently invoked route contracts. [2](#0-1) 

The repository’s enforcing-auth regression test demonstrates the concrete behavior: a rogue hop invoked from `swap_collateral` records a wallet-token `transfer(victim, attacker, amount)` as a child invocation beneath the victim’s `swap_collateral` authorization. [3](#0-2)  With an honest authorization tree the host rejects the rogue transfer and preserves the victim’s wallet balance, but when the victim signs the poisoned tree returned by simulation, the transfer executes while the strategy still completes. [4](#0-3) 

### Impact Explanation
A crafted strategy route can steal unrelated tokens from a user’s wallet, not merely misprice the requested swap. The malicious transfer is authorized because it is embedded in the authorization tree the victim is induced to sign, and the transaction can otherwise appear economically normal. [5](#0-4) 

### Likelihood Explanation
Exploitation requires user interaction: the victim must submit a transaction assembled by a malicious frontend, keeper, or route provider and sign the simulated authorization tree containing the extra transfer. This is the same reachable threat pattern as a crafted web page causing a privileged action: normal users may reasonably sign a strategy transaction without independently decoding every nested Soroban authorization entry. [6](#0-5) 

### Recommendation
Do not execute arbitrary caller-selected route code in the same invocation that consumes the account owner’s authorization. Use a two-phase settlement boundary: first pull the declared strategy input to the controller under an explicit token authorization, then execute the route using only controller invoker-contract authorization. Treat every external hop and emitted authorization requirement as untrusted, and require clients to reject authorization trees containing calls other than the declared input transfer. [7](#0-6) 

### Proof of Concept
1. Victim owns an account and holds `X` units of an unrelated wallet token.
2. Attacker supplies a `swap_collateral` payload whose route invokes a malicious venue; the venue calls `token.transfer(victim, attacker, X)`.
3. Simulation records that token transfer as a child of the victim’s `swap_collateral` authorization, alongside the expected strategy calls. [3](#0-2) 
4. A malicious interface asks the victim to sign the resulting tree.
5. On execution, the venue’s transfer is authorized and `X` is sent to the attacker; the harness shows the victim wallet reaching zero and the attacker receiving `X` while the collateral swap still returns its expected output. [5](#0-4)

```markdown
That bound covers the controller's own grant only. The router calls the pool
and token addresses its payload names and keeps no allowlist of them, so a
route can put third-party code on the call stack below the caller's
authorization. A token transfer that such code makes from the caller is
recorded by an honest simulation as a child of the caller's authorization
entry, and it executes if the caller signs that tree. The loss is then the
caller's wallet, not the routed amount, and neither the payload minimum nor the
final risk gate bounds it. An honest swap strategy gives the caller no child
entry, and a direct router swap gives exactly one input transfer. A client must
decode the route it signs and refuse an authorization tree with any other
child. The direct `execute_strategy` path has the same exposure for every swap
user.
