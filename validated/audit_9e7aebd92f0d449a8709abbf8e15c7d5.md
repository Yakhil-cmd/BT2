### Title
Accrual overflow permanently freezes a saturated high-utilization market - ([File: common/src/rates/index.rs](common/src/rates/index.rs))

### Summary
A sufficiently large, sustained borrow position can drive `borrowed * borrow_index` past the `i128` range before `update_borrow_index` reaches `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, making every subsequent pool mutation fail during mandatory interest accrual. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

### Finding Description
Every pool mutation loads its market through `synced_market`, which unconditionally calls `interest::global_sync`. [3](#0-2)  `global_sync` calls `accrue_step`, whose first operation converts total scaled debt to its original value using `scaled_to_original`. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

`scaled_to_original` is only `scaled.mul(index)`, while `calculate_supplier_rewards` then performs a second scaled-debt multiplication and checked subtraction. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6)  The index cap is applied only after the new index multiplication completes, so it does not prevent the debt-value calculation from overflowing first. [8](#0-7) 

An unprivileged borrower can create this state through `Controller::supply` and `Controller::borrow` when market configuration and available token liquidity permit a sufficiently large debt position; thereafter, permissionless `Controller::update_indexes(caller, assets)` triggers the stuck accrual directly. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)  The repository's harness demonstrates the condition at 98% utilization: `update_indexes` returns `MathOverflow`, the borrow index remains below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, and both `withdraw` and `repay` fail with the same error. [11](#0-10) 

### Impact Explanation
This is a permanent market freeze caused by state-dependent checked arithmetic, not a bounded liquidity refusal. [3](#0-2)  Once the threshold is crossed, suppliers cannot withdraw, borrowers cannot repay, liquidators cannot clear the position, and bad-debt handling cannot proceed because those paths all perform accrual before state mutation. [12](#0-11) [13](#0-12) 

The result is permanent freezing of user funds and inability to operate the affected market from a reachable arithmetic state. [14](#0-13)  Even `update_params` accrues under the old model before writing a replacement, so replacing the rate curve through the ordinary pool path cannot bypass the failed accrual. [15](#0-14) 

### Likelihood Explanation
Exploitation requires an unusually large principal, high sustained utilization, a rate curve capable of compounding the index rapidly, and configured caps high enough to admit the position. [16](#0-15)  The harness uses a billion-unit 18-decimal market, 98% utilization, lifted caps, and repeated ledger advancement to reach the cliff, so the attack is economically demanding rather than generally available on every market. [17](#0-16) 

The feasibility gate is therefore market configuration and token supply, not privileged code execution: once the position exists, the attacker only needs an authorized account action followed by permissionless `update_indexes`. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9) 

### Recommendation
Make accrual saturate safely before value multiplication can overflow: cap `borrow_index` before converting total scaled debt, use widening arithmetic for intermediate debt and supply values, or detect overflow in `accrue_step` and clamp the indexes rather than propagating `MathOverflow`. [18](#0-17)  The same saturation semantics must be shared by `global_sync` and `simulate_update_indexes`, because they intentionally use the same `accrue_step` implementation. [19](#0-18) 

### Proof of Concept
```rust
// On a high-decimal market with caps sufficient for the position:
controller.supply(attacker, account_id, spoke, vec![(collateral_hub_asset, enough_collateral)]);
controller.borrow(attacker, account_id, vec![(debt_hub_asset, principal_98_percent_utilization)], None);

// Advance ledger time until borrowed * borrow_index exceeds i128::MAX.
controller.update_indexes(attacker, vec![debt_hub_asset.clone()]); // MathOverflow

// All subsequently synced operations on debt_hub_asset fail before mutation:
controller.repay(attacker, account_id, vec![(debt_hub_asset.clone(), 1)]); // MathOverflow
controller.withdraw(supplier, supplier_account, vec![(debt_hub_asset, 1)], None); // MathOverflow
```

The repository's executable regression test supplies `BILLION * 10^18`, borrows 98%, advances ledger time until `update_indexes` fails with `MATH_OVERFLOW`, and verifies that withdrawal and repayment hit the same failure. [20](#0-19)
