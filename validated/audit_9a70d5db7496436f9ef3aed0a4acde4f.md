## Finding: Fee-on-transfer / non-conforming ERC20 tokens can desynchronize XCM holding accounting from real balances in `ERC20Transactor`

The Sherlock report's root cause — trusting a token's *declared* transfer amount instead of verifying the *actual* balance delta — has a concrete analog in the Polkadot SDK's `ERC20Transactor`, which lets pallet-revive-deployed ERC20 contracts be referenced as XCM assets on Asset Hub.

### Title
Fee-on-transfer/non-conforming ERC20 contracts break XCM holding-register accounting in `ERC20Transactor` - ([File: cumulus/parachains/runtimes/assets/common/src/erc20_transactor.rs])

### Summary
`ERC20Transactor::withdraw_asset_with_surplus` and `deposit_asset_with_surplus` invoke an arbitrary, user-deployed `IERC20::transfer` call on a contract address taken directly from the XCM `Asset` location, and treat a decoded `true` return value as conclusive proof that the *requested* `amount` moved. Neither function checks the actual balance of the checking account or the beneficiary before/after the call.

### Finding Description
`withdraw_asset_with_surplus` calls `IERC20::transferCall { to: checking_address, value: amount }` on the caller-supplied contract and, if the call doesn't revert and the ABI-decoded return is `true`, unconditionally credits the XCM holding register with `Erc20Credit(amount)` — the exact `amount` requested, not a measured delta: [1](#0-0) 

`deposit_asset_with_surplus` mirrors this: it calls `transfer(beneficiary, amount)` from the checking account and, on a `true` return, simply returns `Ok(surplus)` without confirming the beneficiary's balance actually increased by `amount`: [2](#0-1) 

The comment on `Erc20Credit` explicitly acknowledges that "the actual balance constraints are enforced by the ERC20 smart contract" rather than by the transactor itself: [3](#0-2) 

This is precisely the pattern flagged in the source report: the caller (`ERC20Transactor`) never compares balance-before vs. balance-after; it derives the "actual amount transferred" solely from the boolean return value of an externally-controlled contract's `transfer` function. `TransfersCheckingAccount` is a single, shared, persistent account used by *all* ERC20 assets and *all* users of this transactor: [4](#0-3) 

Any signed account can register/deploy such a contract via `pallet_revive::Pallet::<T>::instantiate`/`bare_instantiate` (a normal, permissionless user entry point) and then reference it in `WithdrawAsset`/`DepositAsset` XCM instructions executed through `PolkadotXcm::execute`, exactly as demonstrated by the existing test harness: [5](#0-4) 

The existing negative tests only cover contracts that revert, return non-bool data, or run out of gas — not the case of a *fully ERC20-compliant* contract that deducts a fee on transfer and still returns `true`: [6](#0-5) 

### Impact Explanation
If a user references a fee-on-transfer-style (but ERC20-compliant, `true`-returning) contract as the XCM asset:
- During `withdraw_asset_with_surplus`, the checking account's *real* token balance increases by less than `amount`, while the XCM holding register is credited with the full nominal `amount`.
- This creates a persistent mismatch between what the shared `TransfersCheckingAccount` actually holds and what the XCM executor believes is available for that asset, since `Erc20Credit` performs no runtime-level balance enforcement of its own.
- Because `TransfersCheckingAccount` is shared across all users/assets handled by this transactor, an under-collateralized credit can interfere with unrelated deposit/withdraw sequences relying on that account's real balance, and any XCM path that forwards the *nominal* credited amount onward (e.g., trapped-asset accounting, or `SetAppendix`/multi-hop XCM that reasons about `AssetsInHolding` amounts rather than re-querying the ERC20 balance) propagates the false "amount" further downstream.

This matches the source report's core concern — the difference between requested and actually-moved token amounts silently corrupting protocol-level accounting — reframed onto XCM's asset-holding bookkeeping instead of a bespoke escrow contract's settlement math.

### Likelihood Explanation
Reachability is fully permissionless: any signed account can deploy an arbitrary Solidity/PVM contract via `pallet-revive` and any signed account (or XCM program) can reference that contract's address as an `AccountKey20` XCM `Asset` in `WithdrawAsset`/`DepositAsset`, both of which are ordinary, already-wired, non-privileged entry points on Asset Hub (`PolkadotXcm::execute`, `pallet_revive::Call::instantiate`). No governance, root, or validator privilege is required.

### Recommendation
In `ERC20Transactor::withdraw_asset_with_surplus` and `deposit_asset_with_surplus`, query the actual `balanceOf` of the checking account / beneficiary immediately before and after the `transfer` call, and use the measured delta — not the requested `amount` — both for the `Erc20Credit` value credited to the XCM holding register and for determining success/failure. If the delta is less than the requested amount, either fail the transaction (`Err(XcmError::FailedToTransactAsset(...))`) or credit only the actually-observed delta, mirroring how `pallet-assets::do_transfer` returns the *actual* transferred amount rather than assuming the requested one.

### Proof of Concept
Reproduction path (built on the existing test harness in `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/assets/asset-hub-westend/tests/tests.rs`, which already exercises this exact transactor with deployed PVM contracts via `bare_instantiate`/`compile_module_with_type`):
1. Add a new fixture contract (analogous to `MyToken`/`MyTokenFake`) implementing `IERC20::transfer` such that it deducts a fee (e.g., burns or retains 10% of `value`) before crediting the recipient, while still returning `true` — i.e., a fully ERC20-ABI-compliant fee-on-transfer token.
2. Deploy it exactly as in `withdraw_and_deposit_erc20s` via `bare_instantiate`.
3. Execute an XCM program via `PolkadotXcm::execute` that does `WithdrawAsset((AccountKey20{key: fee_token_address}, amount))` followed by `DepositAsset(AllCounted(1), beneficiary)`.
4. Assert (a) `checking_account`'s real ERC20 balance after withdraw is `< amount` (fee withheld) while the code path credited the holding register with the full `amount`; and (b) trace whether the subsequent `deposit_asset_with_surplus` call either reverts (checking account underfunded) or, if the fee only applies asymmetrically to inbound transfers, whether `beneficiary`'s real balance ends up `< amount` despite the XCM program having "succeeded" with a credit of `amount`.

I could not execute this reproduction myself (no code-execution tooling available in this session); the guard checks described above (`did_revert()` / `abi_decode_returns_validate` bool check) were confirmed by reading `erc20_transactor.rs` directly, and the absence of any `balanceOf` before/after comparison was confirmed by the same reading — but I have not run `cargo test` to observe the resulting balance mismatch or transaction outcome. This should be executed by a Devin session with repository access before treating the finding as fully confirmed. [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7)
