### Title
RAY value overflow during interest accrual permanently freezes a high-balance market - (File: common/src/rates/scaling.rs)

### Summary

Scaled supply and debt shares remain below `i128::MAX`, while their index-scaled value can exceed `i128::MAX` after interest accrual. The multiply-divide implementation uses an exact `I256` intermediate, but panics when the final quotient cannot be represented as `i128`. [1](#0-0) 

Because every state-changing market operation accrues interest before resolving the requested action, one crossing of this bound makes withdrawal, repayment, liquidation, and further index updates revert with `MathOverflow`. [2](#0-1) 

### Finding Description

`scaled_to_original` converts share balances into RAY-denominated asset values through `Ray::mul`. [3](#0-2) 

`Ray::mul` delegates to `mul_div_half_up`, which widens only the intermediate product to `I256` and still rejects an unrepresentable `i128` quotient with `MathOverflow`. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

`accrue_step` unconditionally computes both `borrowed * borrow_index` and `supplied * supply_index` before deriving utilization, the new borrow index, rewards, or the new supply index. [6](#0-5) 

The pool’s `global_sync` invokes that step for every elapsed chunk and is invoked by `synced_market`, which is used by operation legs such as withdraw and repay. [7](#0-6) [2](#0-1) 

Withdrawal resolution and repayment resolution are therefore unreachable once either stored market total multiplied by its current index exceeds the `i128` domain. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) 

The repository’s own long-horizon test demonstrates the exact cliff: a billion-whole-token, 18-decimal market at 98% utilization eventually fails in `scaled_to_original` before the borrow-index ceiling is reached. [10](#0-9) 

### Impact Explanation

This permanently freezes all funds and debt operations for the affected `(hub_id, asset)` book because the panic occurs during mandatory accrual rather than during an optional final withdrawal calculation. [7](#0-6) [11](#0-10) 

The regression test explicitly confirms that both a withdrawal and a repayment revert with `MathOverflow` after the market crosses the value ceiling. [12](#0-11) 

This is a protocol-wide freeze for that market, not merely an oversized single-position revert, because accrual evaluates aggregate `borrowed` and `supplied` totals. [13](#0-12) 

### Likelihood Explanation

The attack path is unprivileged once a market’s configured caps admit the required exposure: an account can call `supply`, create high utilization through `borrow`, and later call `update_indexes` for the affected `HubAssetKey`. [14](#0-13) [15](#0-14) 

The required capital is large and depends on the asset’s supply, configured caps, collateral value, and sustained utilization, so the practical likelihood is constrained even though the resulting impact is permanent. [16](#0-15) 

The input is nevertheless within the protocol’s admitted numeric domain: the maximum token input is approximately `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)`, while accrued share values can independently overflow before either index reaches its configured ceiling. [16](#0-15) 

### Recommendation

Apply market-specific index ceilings before evaluating `scaled * index`, so the stored totals can never reach an unrepresentable value.

For each accrual step, calculate conservative bounds equivalent to:

```text
max_borrow_index_for_book =
    floor((i128::MAX * RAY - RAY / 2) / borrowed.raw())

max_supply_index_for_book =
    floor((i128::MAX * RAY - RAY / 2) / supplied.raw())
```

Clamp `new_borrow_index` and `new_supply_index` to the lesser of the protocol ceiling and the corresponding book-specific ceiling, and make the ceiling effective before `calculate_supplier_rewards`, `update_supply_index`, or `supply_index_reward_shortfall` performs another share-index multiplication. [17](#0-16) 

Also enforce admission-time caps from the maximum representable accrued value rather than only from the token-to-RAY conversion bound, because a valid deposit today can become unrepresentable after index growth. [18](#0-17) 

### Proof of Concept

The existing regression test constructs the sequence with an 18-decimal market, supplies `1_000_000_000 * 10^18` base units, supplies sufficient collateral, and borrows 98% of the principal. [19](#0-18) 

Repeated calls to `update_indexes` eventually return `MathOverflow` while `borrow_index` is still below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, proving that the aggregate value ceiling—not the index ceiling—causes the failure. [20](#0-19) 

After the overflow, both `withdraw` and `repay` revert with `MathOverflow`, confirming that the market is frozen rather than merely rejecting one oversized input. [21](#0-20)

```markdown
A cap is in native token units. Entry compares stored scaled usage plus the
new scaled amount with the cap floor-converted at the current index. Zero cap
allows no positive exposure. Exits subtract usage without checking caps;
missing usage rows and zero exit deltas are no-ops. Cap→scaled conversion
saturates at `i128::MAX` (`calculate_scaled_cap`), so the entry check fails
open instead of trapping. A saturated scaled cap does not enforce the
configured asset-unit limit. An admitted cap saturates only at an index below
one RAY. Only a bad-debt write-down moves the supply index below one RAY; at
its floor (`RAY / 1000`), a supply cap above 1/1000 of the admitted maximum
saturates. The borrow index never falls below one RAY, so an admitted borrow
cap cannot saturate. Position conversion still rejects overflow.
```

```markdown
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
```
