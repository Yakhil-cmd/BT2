### Title
Permanent market freeze from `i128` value overflow during interest accrual - (`contracts/pool/src/interest.rs`)

### Summary
A sufficiently large market can reach a state where `borrowed * borrow_index` overflows the `RAY`-backed `i128` domain before the configured borrow-index ceiling is reached, causing every subsequent operation that syncs the market to revert. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

### Finding Description
`global_sync` executes `accrue_step` for every elapsed accrual chunk and commits the resulting indexes. [3](#0-2)  `accrue_step` first calculates `borrowed_original` and `supplied_original` through `scaled_to_original`, which performs `scaled.mul(index)`. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4)  `Ray::mul` uses checked fixed-point multiplication and raises `GenericError::MathOverflow` when the intermediate value exceeds the representable domain. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

The pool's shared `synced_market` and `renewed_market` helpers run this accrual before ordinary market mutations, while permissionless `controller::update_indexes(caller, assets)` forwards the assets to `pool::update_indexes`, which invokes the same `global_sync`. [2](#0-1) [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) 

The project already contains a regression demonstrating the cliff: a market holding one billion 18-decimal tokens at roughly 98% utilization eventually fails inside `scaled_to_original`, while the borrow index remains below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [10](#0-9) 

### Impact Explanation
Once the overflow threshold is crossed, `withdraw` and `repay` both fail with `MathOverflow`, and the same accrual-first structure prevents borrowers, suppliers, and liquidators from reaching the affected market's settlement logic. [11](#0-10) [12](#0-11) [13](#0-12)  Because the panicking accrual is the prerequisite for subsequent calls and does not persist a recovery state, the market remains frozen rather than merely rejecting one oversized request. [14](#0-13)  This permanently freezes supplier funds and blocks debt reduction or liquidation unless privileged intervention or an upgrade repairs the market. [15](#0-14) 

### Likelihood Explanation
Triggering the condition requires an extremely large admitted market, sustained high utilization, and enough ledger time for index growth to make the scaled debt's original value overflow; the existing test reaches that state after multiple simulated years and requires lifted caps. [16](#0-15)  Nevertheless, the final trigger is permissionless: any caller can invoke `update_indexes(caller, assets)` for the affected `HubAssetKey`, and `caller` authorization does not provide any privilege over the market. [17](#0-16) [8](#0-7)  The issue is therefore a medium-severity availability failure rather than an immediate low-cost denial-of-service vector. [18](#0-17) 

### Recommendation
Track and enforce the maximum representable `scaled * index` value separately from the index ceiling, either by using wider intermediate arithmetic for utilization and accrual or by capping accrual before the value product can overflow. [19](#0-18)  Market entry should also reject additional scaled supply or debt whenever projected accrual to the configured index bound would exceed the `i128` value domain. [20](#0-19)  If saturation is intentional, accrual should transition to a terminal no-growth state while preserving `repay`, `withdraw`, liquidation, cleanup, and recapitalization paths instead of panicking in the shared sync preflight. [2](#0-1) 

### Proof of Concept
An unprivileged whale can create one account with `supply(caller, 0, spoke_id, [(hub_asset, principal)])`, create or use another account with sufficient collateral, and call `borrow(caller, account_id, [(hub_asset, debt)], to)` to hold the market near full utilization. [21](#0-20)  After enough ledger time passes for `borrowed * borrow_index` to exceed the `RAY` `i128` domain, the caller submits `update_indexes(caller, [hub_asset])`; the pool loads the market, calls `global_sync`, and panics in `scaled_to_original` before committing a usable accrued state. [9](#0-8) [22](#0-21) 

Thereafter, calls equivalent to `withdraw(caller, supplier_account, [(hub_asset, amount)], to)` and `repay(caller, borrower_account, [(hub_asset, amount)])` still enter the pool's accrual-first path and revert with `MathOverflow`, exactly as demonstrated by `a_whale_market_at_sustained_high_utilization_hits_the_ray_value_ceiling_before_the_index_cap`. [11](#0-10) [23](#0-22)

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
