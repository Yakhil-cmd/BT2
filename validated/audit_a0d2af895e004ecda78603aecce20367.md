```rust
pub struct MovePackage {
    id: ObjectID,
    /// Most move packages are uniquely identified by their ID (i.e. there is only one version per
    /// ID), but the version is still stored because one package may be an upgrade of another (at a
    /// different ID), in which case its version will be one greater than the version of the
    /// upgraded package.
    ///
    /// Framework packages are an exception to this rule -- all versions of the framework packages
    /// exist at the same ID, at increasing versions.
    ///
    /// In all cases, packages are referred to by move calls using just their ID, and they are
    /// always loaded at their latest version.
