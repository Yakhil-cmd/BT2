### Title
`WalletContract::has_in_flight_tx` lock rejects legitimate ETH-emulated transactions when a prior call has not resolved - ([File: runtime/near-wallet-contract/implementation/wallet-contract/src/lib.rs])

### Summary
The `near-wallet-contract` (Aurora's ETH-implicit-account wallet contract, deployed as a global contract on NEAR and reachable from any submitted transaction/receipt) enforces a single-flight lock, `has_in_flight_tx`, that is very similar in structure to the reported `nonETHReuse` bug: it is a shared piece of persistent state that any caller of `rlp_execute` can set, and while set, causes any subsequent `rlp_execute` call to be rejected, only being cleared by a specific internal callback path.

### Finding Description
`WalletContract` stores a boolean flag `has_in_flight_tx` alongside the account's nonce: [1](#0-0) 

`rlp_execute` is the sole entry point that turns an RLP-encoded Ethereum transaction into a NEAR promise/action. At the very top it checks the flag and immediately rejects the call if a previous call's promise chain has not yet resolved: [2](#0-1) 

The flag is only cleared inside the private callbacks (`address_check_callback`, `nep_141_storage_balance_callback`, `rlp_execute_callback`, `ban_relayer`), which fire only after the outstanding cross-contract promise chain resolves: [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) 

This is functionally analogous to the reported `nonETHReuse` modifier: a shared, contract-scoped "entered" flag is set by whichever call reaches the contract first, and any later call — even from a different, unrelated relayer/caller acting on behalf of the same eth-implicit account — is rejected until the in-flight chain finishes.

The contract's own test suite explicitly documents and validates this exact behavior: [5](#0-4) 

The comment on `inner_rlp_execute` acknowledges the single-flight design is intentional as a defense against a malicious/faulty relayer racing ahead of the legitimate nonce-incrementing flow: [6](#0-5) 

Unlike the reported Solidity bug, there is no `Multicall`-style "unlock" transaction here — the lock is reset only by execution of the outstanding promise chain (success, failure, or the address-registrar/NEP-141 callback paths). Because `rlp_execute` returns a `PromiseOrValue`, and NEAR's runtime executes receipts (including cross-contract calls and their callbacks) asynchronously across blocks, there is a window — spanning potentially multiple blocks while the promise chain for one relayer's call is pending — during which any other relayer's (or the user's own) legitimately-signed `rlp_execute` call for the same eth-implicit account is rejected outright with `"transaction already in progress"`.

### Impact Explanation
Impact is limited to denial of service for a single eth-implicit account's pending transaction, not token theft or unauthorized state change. A user's or competing relayer's otherwise valid, correctly-nonced `rlp_execute` call gets rejected (`success: false`, `error: "transaction already in progress, please try again later"`) purely because another relayer's call for the same account is mid-flight. This can be triggered by anyone who is permitted to call `rlp_execute` for that account (e.g. any relayer holding a function-call access key, or the account itself), so it is reachable from unprivileged submitted transactions/receipts as required.

### Likelihood Explanation
Likelihood is low-to-medium. This requires either two relayers racing to serve the same user, or a malicious relayer intentionally initiating a long-lived promise chain (e.g. targeting a slow/failing cross-contract call, or the NEP-141 storage-balance / address-registrar callback paths, which chain multiple promises) to keep `has_in_flight_tx = true` across several blocks, thereby blocking the legitimate user's/other relayer's subsequent transaction for as long as the chain is outstanding. This is a griefing/DoS vector rather than a fund-theft vector, and the flag resets automatically once the promise chain resolves (success or failure) — it does not require the user to find a special "unlock" transaction as in the reported bug, so the practical severity is lower than the original finding.

### Recommendation
Consider whether the single-in-flight-transaction invariant needs to be per-caller/relayer rather than global to the account, or add a bounded timeout/expiry so that a stalled promise chain cannot indefinitely (across many blocks) block legitimate subsequent `rlp_execute` calls. At minimum, document the maximum expected duration a promise chain can remain "in flight" (bounded by attached gas and NEAR's cross-contract call depth/gas limits) so integrators can reason about the worst-case lock-out window.

### Proof of Concept
The contract's own test (`test_simultaneous_transactions`) reproduces the core lock behavior: batching two `rlp_execute` calls in the same NEAR transaction shows the second is rejected with `"transaction already in progress"` while the first is still resolving its promise chain: [5](#0-4) 
The same effect is reachable across separate NEAR transactions/blocks (not just within one batched transaction): as long as `has_in_flight_tx` remains `true` (i.e., the first call's promise/callback chain hasn't resolved), any other party's `rlp_execute` call submitted in a later block for the same account will be rejected the same way, per the check at the top of `rlp_execute`: [7](#0-6)
