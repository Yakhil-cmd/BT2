# Q4099: verifyKzgProof - verify agrees with compute via Java [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyKzgProof via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_kzg_proof(compute_kzg_proof(blob,z)) == true for every blob and z so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: verify_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyKzgProof via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_kzg_proof accepts exactly the (proof,y) that compute_kzg_proof produced for the same z (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: verify_kzg_proof(compute_kzg_proof(blob,z)) == true for every blob and z.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: verify_kzg_proof(compute_kzg_proof(blob,z)) == true for every blob and z (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
