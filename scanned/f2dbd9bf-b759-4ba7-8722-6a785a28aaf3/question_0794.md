# Q0794: case, trailing dot, and IDN normalization - clientOptions in client.go

## Question
Can `clientOptions` in [api/client.go](api/client.go#L256) be fed `GitHub.com.`, an IDN homograph, or a percent-encoded host that normalizes differently for the trust check than for the connection?

## Target
- File/function: [api/client.go:256](api/client.go#L256) - `clientOptions`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated command against attacker-influenced coordinates (gh api, gh pr list, gh repo view -R ...)
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Use a trailing-dot or unicode variant in a remote URL so validation and dialing disagree.
- Invariant to test: Hostnames are lowercased, punycode-normalized, and dot-trimmed once, before both use sites.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Exfiltration of the victim's GitHub OAuth token / git credentials to an attacker-controlled host (sensitive credential disclosure)
- Fast validation: Fuzz host strings asserting normalize(validate(h)) == host used to dial.
