# Q0386: digest bound to the wrong bytes - checkInstalledSkillDirs in publish.go

## Question
Does `checkInstalledSkillDirs` in [pkg/cmd/skills/publish/publish.go](pkg/cmd/skills/publish/publish.go#L905) compute or compare the artifact digest over data other than the exact bytes the user will run (for example a re-downloaded copy, a decompressed stream, or a manifest field)?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/skills/publish/publish.go:905](pkg/cmd/skills/publish/publish.go#L905) - `checkInstalledSkillDirs`
- Entrypoint: gh skills publish
- Attacker controls: a published skill's archive entries, frontmatter, and registry metadata
- Exploit idea: Serve one artifact for verification and a different one for the actual download.
- Invariant to test: The verified digest is computed over the same bytes that are written to disk and returned to the caller.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Supply-chain verification bypass: unsigned or wrongly attributed artifact reported as verified
- Fast validation: Test where the byte stream differs between verify and write, asserting a failure.
