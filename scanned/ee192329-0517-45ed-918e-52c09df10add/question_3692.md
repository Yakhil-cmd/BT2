# Q3692: find-collateral-amount via collateral-remove-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `find-collateral-amount` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
