# Q4509: total-assets via deposit: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, drive `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) — which adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `deposit` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets` touches, run `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
