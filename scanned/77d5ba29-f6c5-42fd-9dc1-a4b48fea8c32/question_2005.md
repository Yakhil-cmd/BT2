# Q2005: accrue-user-debts via supply-collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) — which folds accrual over the position's debt list only — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `accrue-user-debts` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
