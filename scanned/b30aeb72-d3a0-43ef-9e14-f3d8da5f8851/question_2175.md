# Q2175: ubalance via redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `min-out`, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `ubalance` touches, run `redeem` with `min-out`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
