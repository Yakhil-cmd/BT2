# Q5741: merge-price via borrow: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) — which attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
