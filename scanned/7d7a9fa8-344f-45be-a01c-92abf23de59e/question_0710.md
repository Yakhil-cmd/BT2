# Q0710: get_version_and_snapshot_files lets attacker data change the committed hash (snapshot_utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `get_version_and_snapshot_files` in `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and make the bank's capitalization counter disagree with the sum of lamports across all accounts, so that the invariant "The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` -> `get_version_and_snapshot_files()` (around line 1108)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Author account/instruction data so `get_version_and_snapshot_files` contributes differently on nodes that took different but legal internal paths, producing a bank-hash mismatch.
- Invariant to test: The hash contribution is a pure function of committed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Compute the hash via both code paths (e.g. incremental vs full recompute) on the same state and assert equality.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
