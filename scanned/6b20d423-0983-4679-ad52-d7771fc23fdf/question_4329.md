# Q4329: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - column-aggregation interpolation collision via Java [an-ascending-list-with-one-column-index]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with an ascending list with one column index repeated later, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that aggregated interpolation commitment == the true column polynomial iff each cell is genuine so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an ascending list with one column index repeated later. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: aggregate crafted cells in one column so the interpolation poly matches the commitment without any single cell being valid (an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
- Invariant to test: aggregated interpolation commitment == the true column polynomial iff each cell is genuine.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: aggregated interpolation commitment == the true column polynomial iff each cell is genuine (input: an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
