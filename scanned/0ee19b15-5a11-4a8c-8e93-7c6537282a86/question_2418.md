# Q2418: symlink not resolved before write - checkForUpdate in cmd.go

## Question
Does `checkForUpdate` in [internal/ghcmd/cmd.go](internal/ghcmd/cmd.go#L318) write through a path component that may already be a symlink created earlier by the same attacker-controlled payload?

## Target
- File/function: [internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:318](internal/ghcmd/cmd.go#L318) - `checkForUpdate`
- Entrypoint: gh extension install
- Attacker controls: an extension repository, its release assets, and its manifest fields
- Exploit idea: Have the payload create `dir -> /home/victim/.ssh` first, then a file under `dir/`.
- Invariant to test: Writes resolve symlinks and reject any component leaving the root (O_NOFOLLOW semantics).
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Arbitrary file write or overwrite outside the intended directory, escalating to code execution via startup files, git hooks, or gh's own config
- Fast validation: Integration test extracting a two-entry payload (symlink then file) and asserting the outside target is untouched.
