# Q3513: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - num_cells not upper-bounded via C [an-empty-batch-n-0]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with an empty batch (n == 0), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an empty batch (n == 0). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass a num_cells far above CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB and drive the input_size / calloc arithmetic in the challenge toward overflow (an empty batch (n == 0)).
- Invariant to test: allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps (input: an empty batch (n == 0)).
