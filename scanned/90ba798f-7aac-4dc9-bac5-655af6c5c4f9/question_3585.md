# Q3585: community-treasury drift via runtimecall encointercommunities signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCommunities` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated, breaking the invariant that XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally, and leading to high - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCommunities` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules
- Exploit idea: lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated
- Invariant to test: XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
