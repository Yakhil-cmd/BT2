# Q3614: cross-ceremony state bleed via runtimecall encointerbalances or encointerofflinepayment on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state, breaking the invariant that batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of community funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path
- Attacker controls: offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state
- Invariant to test: batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of community funds
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over the exact community, ceremony, and payout sequence with balance and reputation assertions
