# Q4305: repoSync.worktreeFor — root symlink normalise under subpath mount

## Question
Under a consumer that mounts a subPath of the shared volume rather than the whole volume, an attacker plants a symlink component inside --root that appears after the initial `EvalSymlinks` normalisation. In worktreeFor()/worktree.Hash(), which derive identity from the leaf name of `.worktrees/<hash>`, can that mean later Join()/Split() operations resolve through it, moving worktree and link operations outside the normalised root, so that the invariant “root normalisation holds for the process lifetime” no longer holds and the outcome is writes and deletes outside --root?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.worktreeFor / worktree.Hash`
- Entrypoint: attacker push (or co-tenant write on the shared --root volume) -> publishSymlink()/currentWorktree() on the next sync
- Attacker controls: Plants a symlink component inside --root that appears after the initial `EvalSymlinks` normalisation. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: later Join()/Split() operations resolve through it, moving worktree and link operations outside the normalised root
- Invariant to test: root normalisation holds for the process lifetime
- Expected Immunefi impact: writes and deletes outside --root (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: assert every path git-sync creates under the link directory is owned by git-sync and not writable by other UIDs
