# Q3310: calc-liq-factor via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-factor` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703` -> `calc-liq-factor`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
