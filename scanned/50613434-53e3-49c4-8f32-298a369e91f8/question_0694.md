# Q694: blobToKzgCommitment - commitment via the zero-point filter in g1_lincomb_fast via Java [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.blobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: g1_lincomb_fast)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.blobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply a blob so that g1_lincomb_fast's `blst_p1_is_inf` filter drops coefficients and yields the identity commitment while the polynomial is non-zero (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
