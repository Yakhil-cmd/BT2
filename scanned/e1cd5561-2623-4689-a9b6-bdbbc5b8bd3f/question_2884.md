# Q2884: RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs - minimum-cells boundary via CSharp [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery proceeds iff num_cells >= CELLS_PER_BLOB, matching the reference so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: call with exactly 63 (too few) and exactly 64 cells and confirm the boundary guard is exact (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: recovery proceeds iff num_cells >= CELLS_PER_BLOB, matching the reference.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: recovery proceeds iff num_cells >= CELLS_PER_BLOB, matching the reference (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
