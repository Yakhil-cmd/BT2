# Q1696: fee-conversion inconsistency via foreignassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
