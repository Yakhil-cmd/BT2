# Q3091: sub-account deposit leak via identity set identity clear on People Kusama identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Kusama identity config and control inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched so that `IdentityInfo / fields()` makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination, breaking the invariant that encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityInfo / fields()`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched
- Exploit idea: makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination
- Invariant to test: encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
