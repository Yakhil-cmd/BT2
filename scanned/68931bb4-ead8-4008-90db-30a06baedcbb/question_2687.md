# Q2687: Replay stale context

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and replay a stale `private channel` into `echo_ready_thresholds` by controlling `n`, `protocol message timing`, so this code path accepts state from an earlier session as current and eventually enables Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::echo_ready_thresholds`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `n`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Capture a valid `private channel` from one run and inject it into a fresh run with overlapping participants before the expected check fires.
- Invariant to test: `private channel` must be bound to the live session, participant set, and exact transcript that consumes it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `private channel` data into `echo_ready_thresholds`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
