# Q3979: Swap participant ordering

## Question
Can a malicious participant below threshold enter through `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` with crafted `v` and exploit `set_non_identity_constant` so participant ordering or identifier mapping for `serialized scalar` differs across nodes, breaking signer-set consistency and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/crypto/polynomials.rs::set_non_identity_constant`
- Entrypoint: `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `v`
- Exploit idea: Reorder or relabel participant-specific `serialized scalar` values and look for divergent Lagrange or identifier handling.
- Invariant to test: Participant identifiers, ordering, and Lagrange weights must map 1:1 to the intended signer set.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Construct a deterministic unit or invariant test around `crypto::polynomials::set_non_identity_constant` that feeds crafted `serialized scalar` / `hash output` inputs, then assert whether downstream verification accepts an output that should have been rejected.
