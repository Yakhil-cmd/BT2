# Q4953: VerifyBlobKzgProof - challenge transcript match via CSharp [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the verify-side compute_challenge transcript equals the prove-side and the spec (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
