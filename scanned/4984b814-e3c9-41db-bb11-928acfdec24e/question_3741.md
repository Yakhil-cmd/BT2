# Q3741: repoSync.SetupGitSSH — logsafeflags gap under ssh default

## Question
Does SetupGitSSH()'s `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND` string building, SetupCookieFile(), and the redaction helpers redactURL()/logSafeFlags() stay safe when an attacker relies on a code path where a secret-bearing flag value is logged without going through the password/repo/credential special cases in SSH auth with the default `--ssh-known-hosts=false` — or can the secret appears in the startup log and, on error, in --error-file, violating “no flag value containing a secret is ever printed” and producing credential disclosure?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupGitSSH / SetupCookieFile / redactURL / logSafeFlags`
- Entrypoint: attacker-controlled repo content or redirect target -> refreshCreds()/credential helper during the sync
- Attacker controls: Relies on a code path where a secret-bearing flag value is logged without going through the password/repo/credential special cases. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: the secret appears in the startup log and, on error, in --error-file
- Invariant to test: no flag value containing a secret is ever printed
- Expected Immunefi impact: credential disclosure (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: run a local auth endpoint / fixture remote that records what it receives and assert no credential reaches any host but the configured one
