# Q40: offers via SelectOfferFile 40

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the offer accept/cancel confirmation flow in `SelectOfferFile` (packages/gui/src/components/offers/OfferImport.tsx) control conflicting offer IDs and secure-cancel flags with a delayed metadata fetch and drive the sequence load persisted state -> render approval -> execute command so the GUI would cancel or accept a tradeId different from the row the user selected, violating the invariant that secure cancellation and ownership checks must remain bound to the selected trade, leading to Critical: unauthorized offer acceptance/cancellation or wrong-asset transfer; High: spoofed offer state causing approval of the wrong assets?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/gui/src/components/offers/OfferImport.tsx` / `SelectOfferFile`
- Entrypoint: offer accept/cancel confirmation flow
- Attacker controls: conflicting offer IDs and secure-cancel flags; with a delayed metadata fetch
- Exploit idea: cancel or accept a tradeId different from the row the user selected
- Invariant to test: secure cancellation and ownership checks must remain bound to the selected trade
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unauthorized offer acceptance/cancellation or wrong-asset transfer; High: spoofed offer state causing approval of the wrong assets
- Fast validation: mock remote fetch responses before and after preview and assert the submit path revalidates identity-critical fields
