# Q0530: filter-u128 via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `filter-u128` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
