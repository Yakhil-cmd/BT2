# Q2264: wrong-asset bridge settlement via assethubpolkadot pallet xcm send on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `XcmMessageProcessor` causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes, breaking the invariant that bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `XcmMessageProcessor`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation`
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes
- Invariant to test: bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
