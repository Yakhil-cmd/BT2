# Q3471: socialize-debt-asset via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`socialize-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879) calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879` -> `socialize-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt-asset` calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `socialize-debt-asset` touches, run `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
