# Q1434: merge-price via liquidate: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `borrower`, any third-party principal across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
