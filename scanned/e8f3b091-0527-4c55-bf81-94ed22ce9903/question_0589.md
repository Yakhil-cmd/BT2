# Q0589: oracle-last-update via call-ststx-ratio: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, drive `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) — which returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, then read `oracle-last-update` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
