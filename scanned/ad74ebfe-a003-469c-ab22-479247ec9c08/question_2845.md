# Q2845: Bypass proof binding

## Question
Can a single malicious participant or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign(...)`, `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::sign(...)`, or the triple-generation pipeline` and control `v`, `protocol message timing` so `and_vec_mut` accepts a `beta share` proof, commitment, or hash that is not bound to the exact sender/session/role context, leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/ecdsa/ot_based_ecdsa/triples/bits.rs::and_vec_mut`
- Entrypoint: `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign(...)`, `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::sign(...)`, or the triple-generation pipeline`
- Attacker controls: `v`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Pair a proof/hash for one sender or session with a different `beta share` payload and see whether the binding check is incomplete.
- Invariant to test: Proofs, commitments, and hashes must be bound to the exact sender, session, and role they certify.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign(...)`, `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::sign(...)`, or the triple-generation pipeline`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `beta share` data into `and_vec_mut`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
