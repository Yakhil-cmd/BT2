# Q3407: VerifyBlobKzgProofBatch - batch cancellation of an invalid triple via CSharp [an-empty-batch-n-0]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with an empty batch (n == 0), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch verdict == AND of the per-triple verdicts; no linear combination cancels a forgery so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an empty batch (n == 0). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft two triples whose r-weighted contributions cancel so a forged triple passes inside the batch (an empty batch (n == 0)).
- Invariant to test: batch verdict == AND of the per-triple verdicts; no linear combination cancels a forgery.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: batch verdict == AND of the per-triple verdicts; no linear combination cancels a forgery (input: an empty batch (n == 0)).
