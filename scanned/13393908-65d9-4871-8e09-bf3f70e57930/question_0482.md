# Q482: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - recovered output matches the reference via Rust [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovered (cells,proofs) == the reference recovery for the same inputs so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: differentially compare recovered cells/proofs against Rust-Eth-KZG (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: recovered (cells,proofs) == the reference recovery for the same inputs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: recovered (cells,proofs) == the reference recovery for the same inputs (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
