# Q2135: computeBlobKzgProof - challenge transcript layout in compute_challenge via Zig [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.computeBlobKzgProof via root.zig` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.computeBlobKzgProof via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm compute_challenge hashes FSBLOBVERIFY_V1_ | 0 | FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB | blob | commitment in exactly the spec's byte order and widths (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
