# Q1811: accrue-user-debts via accrue: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `accrue` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
