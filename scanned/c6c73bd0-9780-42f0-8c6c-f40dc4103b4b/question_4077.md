# Q4077: resolve-or-create via supply-collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) — which allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-or-create` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
