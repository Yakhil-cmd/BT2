# Q4907: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
