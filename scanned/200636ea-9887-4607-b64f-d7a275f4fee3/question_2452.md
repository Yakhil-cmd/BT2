# Q2452: find-superset via liquidate: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `liquidate` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
