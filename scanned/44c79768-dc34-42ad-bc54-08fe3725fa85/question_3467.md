# Q3467: query or topic reuse via signed user flow that on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `Barrier` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
