# Q2972: accrue-user-collateral via redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
