# Q5944: get-bitmap via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
