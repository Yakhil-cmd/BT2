# Q3234: active via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, can an unprivileged attacker make `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `active` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
