# Q3915: BlobToKZGCommitment - commitment from a non-canonical blob element via Go [a-value-in-r-2-256-that-blst-scalar-fr-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.BlobToKZGCommitment (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that every field element committed == the canonical decode of the blob bytes, or the call returns C_KZG_BADARGS so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: blob_to_polynomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.BlobToKZGCommitment (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical 32-byte field element in the blob and check blob_to_polynomial/bytes_to_bls_field rejects it before poly_to_kzg_commitment runs (a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject).
- Invariant to test: every field element committed == the canonical decode of the blob bytes, or the call returns C_KZG_BADARGS.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: every field element committed == the canonical decode of the blob bytes, or the call returns C_KZG_BADARGS (input: a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject).
