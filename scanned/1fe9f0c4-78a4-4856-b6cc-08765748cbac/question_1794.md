# Q1794: Snowbridge export bypass via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
