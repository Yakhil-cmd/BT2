# Q3168: rpc-state via Wallets 3168

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the daemon RPC response handling in `Wallets` (packages/wallets/src/components/Wallets.tsx) control RPC error payload shaped like success with conflicting localStorage preferences and drive the sequence preview -> mutate controlled state -> confirm so the GUI would correlate a command response to the wrong pending request, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/wallets/src/components/Wallets.tsx` / `Wallets`
- Entrypoint: daemon RPC response handling
- Attacker controls: RPC error payload shaped like success; with conflicting localStorage preferences
- Exploit idea: correlate a command response to the wrong pending request
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: write a unit test around the component/hook with controlled state updates and inspect the final mutation payload
