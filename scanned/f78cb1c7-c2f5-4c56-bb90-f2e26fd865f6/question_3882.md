# Q3882: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via signed user flow that on Bulletin Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Bulletin through valid upstream XCM` on Bulletin Polkadot XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bulletin/bulletin-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Bulletin through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
