# Q122: proxy-type widening via multisig as multi remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::register_remote_proxy_proof` causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended, breaking the invariant that revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::register_remote_proxy_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended
- Invariant to test: revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: nested batch and multisig test asserting exactly which proof is popped and which call consumes it
