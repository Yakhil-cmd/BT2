# Q3903: vault-system-repay via liquidate-multi: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-system-repay` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
