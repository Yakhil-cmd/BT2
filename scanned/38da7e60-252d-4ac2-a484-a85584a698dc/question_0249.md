# Q0249: native-to-CRC21 auto deploy under same-block reorder cross-phase equality

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through MsgConvertVouchers for non-IbcCroDenom native assets by controlling sender, denom, amount, auto-deploy state and mapping state when two attacker-controlled transactions are valid separately but reordered in one block, then register or use the wrong auto-deployed CRC21 contract for a valuable denom so that one denom has one canonical backed contract and no duplicate redeemable supply fails and CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: x/cronos/keeper/evm.go::ConvertCoinFromNativeToCRC21
- Entrypoint: MsgConvertVouchers for non-IbcCroDenom native assets
- Attacker controls: sender, denom, amount, auto-deploy state and mapping state; scenario focus: same-block reorder plus cross-phase equality.
- Exploit idea: register or use the wrong auto-deployed CRC21 contract for a valuable denom while two attacker-controlled transactions are valid separately but reordered in one block.
- Invariant to test: one denom has one canonical backed contract and no duplicate redeemable supply; also verify CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: use a malicious minimal EVM contract or marshaled protobuf payload to exercise the entrypoint and inspect all state diffs.
