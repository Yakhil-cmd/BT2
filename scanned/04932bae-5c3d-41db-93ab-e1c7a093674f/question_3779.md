# Q3779: calculate_default_compute_unit_limit arithmetic overflows on reachable values (compute_budget_instruction_details.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `calculate_default_compute_unit_limit` in `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` with values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker, and make the arithmetic in `calculate_default_compute_unit_limit` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` -> `calculate_default_compute_unit_limit()` (around line 196)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `calculate_default_compute_unit_limit` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `calculate_default_compute_unit_limit` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
