# Q3570: rpc-state via Peak 3570

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the daemon RPC response handling in `Peak` (packages/api/src/@types/Peak.ts) control subscription event for a different wallet/fingerprint during a pending modal confirmation and drive the sequence load persisted state -> render approval -> execute command so the GUI would mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/@types/Peak.ts` / `Peak`
- Entrypoint: daemon RPC response handling
- Attacker controls: subscription event for a different wallet/fingerprint; during a pending modal confirmation
- Exploit idea: mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: mock the service layer and assert no RPC call is made unless displayed and submitted fields match
