# Q3026: resolve-interpolation-points via deposit: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `deposit` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call varied, and assert that the value `resolve-interpolation-points` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
