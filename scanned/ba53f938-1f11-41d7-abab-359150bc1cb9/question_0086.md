# Q0086: next-index via deposit: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `deposit` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `next-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
