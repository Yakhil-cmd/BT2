# Q3851: remove-user-scaled-debt via repay: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `repay` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
