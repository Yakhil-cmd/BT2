# Q3615: resolve-callcode via collateral-remove: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-callcode` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
