# Q1902: find-asset via collateral-remove-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver` for the underlying leg across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `find-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
