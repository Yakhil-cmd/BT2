# Q3827: Alias two identities into one slot

## Question
Can a malicious participant below threshold enter through `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and craft `participant` so `eval_at_participant` treats two logical participants or sessions as the same `Lagrange coefficient` slot, overwrites state, and leads to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/crypto/polynomials.rs::eval_at_participant`
- Entrypoint: `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `participant`
- Exploit idea: Create two attacker-controlled representations that collide onto one `Lagrange coefficient` slot inside maps or buffers.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-controlled alias may overwrite another participant's state slot or session slot.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Construct a deterministic unit or invariant test around `crypto::polynomials::eval_at_participant` that feeds crafted `Lagrange coefficient` / `polynomial` inputs, then assert whether downstream verification accepts an output that should have been rejected.
