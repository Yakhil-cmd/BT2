# Q267: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - large-n allocation/size arithmetic via Python [a-2-item-batch-where-item-0-is-valid-and]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: drive input_size = DOMAIN + 2*u64 + n*(commit+2*fe+proof) toward size_t overflow (a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged).
- Invariant to test: the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs (input: a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged).
