# Q1226: rpc-state via getNetworkInfo 1226

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the RTK query cache update in `getNetworkInfo` (packages/gui/src/electron/api/getNetworkInfo.ts) control RPC error payload shaped like success with a redirected remote resource and drive the sequence load persisted state -> render approval -> execute command so the GUI would transform attacker-controlled keys into privileged fields, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/gui/src/electron/api/getNetworkInfo.ts` / `getNetworkInfo`
- Entrypoint: RTK query cache update
- Attacker controls: RPC error payload shaped like success; with a redirected remote resource
- Exploit idea: transform attacker-controlled keys into privileged fields
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: exercise the Electron IPC or WalletConnect command handler with crafted params and assert approval classification is strict
