# Q4998: get-egroup via repay: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `repay` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `get-egroup` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
