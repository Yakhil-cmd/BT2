# Q3224: collector_type_checked behaves inconsistently at a feature/epoch boundary (fee_distribution.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `collector_type_checked` in `runtime/src/bank/fee_distribution.rs` with a payload that satisfies the cheap precondition but not the full check, and have `collector_type_checked` evaluated under one rule during banking and a different one during replay, so that the invariant "A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/fee_distribution.rs` -> `collector_type_checked()` (around line 241)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a payload that satisfies the cheap precondition but not the full check
- Exploit idea: Land the transaction exactly on the slot where the gate flips so `collector_type_checked` is evaluated under one rule during scheduling and another during replay.
- Invariant to test: A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Replay the same transaction against banks on both sides of the boundary and assert both nodes agree on accept/reject and result.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
