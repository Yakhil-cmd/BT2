# Q4749: blobToKzgCommitment - Lagrange-vs-monomial commitment agreement via Java [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.blobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: poly_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.blobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the commitment from g1_values_lagrange_brp equals the monomial-basis commitment of the same polynomial (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
