# Q340: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - infinity cell proof filtered from the lincomb via Elixir [the-compressed-point-at-infinity-0xc0-th]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok true iff every proof opens its cell; a filtered infinity proof cannot pass so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: g1_lincomb_fast)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: include a proof that is the point at infinity so g1_lincomb_fast drops it while its r^i weight still scales the commitment side (the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
- Invariant to test: *ok true iff every proof opens its cell; a filtered infinity proof cannot pass.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: *ok true iff every proof opens its cell; a filtered infinity proof cannot pass (input: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
