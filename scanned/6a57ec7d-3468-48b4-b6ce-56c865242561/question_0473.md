# Q473: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet teleport assets on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `LocalOriginConverter` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
