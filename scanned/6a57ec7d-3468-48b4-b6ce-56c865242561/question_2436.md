# Q2436: referendum replay via polkadotxcm execute on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control user-controlled inputs that feed plurality-like execution or post-deposit cleanup logic so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}` induces a state where execution succeeds but deposit, refund, or scheduling state remains inconsistent, breaking the invariant that signed users must not escalate into privileged collective execution through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing, and leading to high - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: user-controlled inputs that feed plurality-like execution or post-deposit cleanup logic
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but deposit, refund, or scheduling state remains inconsistent
- Invariant to test: signed users must not escalate into privileged collective execution through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact
- Fast validation: xcm test if the path depends on aliased pluralities or remote execution
