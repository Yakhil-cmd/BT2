# Q1892: fee-asset undercharge path via assethubpolkadot signed user path on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `MessageExporter` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `MessageExporter`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
