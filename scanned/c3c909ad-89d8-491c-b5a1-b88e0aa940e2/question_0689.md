# Q689: beneficiary resolution split via xcmpallet execute on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::execute` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `SovereignAccountOf` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::execute`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
