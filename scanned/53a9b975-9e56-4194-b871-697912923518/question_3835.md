# Q3835: ComputeKZGProof - canonical y_out serialization via Go [a-value-in-r-2-256-that-blst-scalar-fr-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.ComputeKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z) so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_kzg_proof (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.ComputeKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bytes_from_bls_field emits the canonical y for boundary field values (a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject).
- Invariant to test: y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z) (input: a value in [r, 2^256) that blst_scalar_fr_check must reject).
