# Q4444: resolve-pyth via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
