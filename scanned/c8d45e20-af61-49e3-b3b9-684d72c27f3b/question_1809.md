# Q1809: is-liquidation-paused via liquidate-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `is-liquidation-paused` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691) — which returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691` -> `is-liquidation-paused`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `is-liquidation-paused` returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `is-liquidation-paused` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
