# Q2084: queue-finalization replay via assethubpolkadot signed bridge frontend on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over message ordering, beneficiary choice, and queue state with one-settlement assertions
