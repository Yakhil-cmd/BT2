# Q3627: touch — errorfile delete race under http pprof

## Question
Does touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state stay safe when an attacker alternates success and failure each period in `--http-pprof` enabled for debugging — or can DeleteErrorFile() and writeContent() race, leaving a stale error visible after a successful sync or no error after a failure, violating “the error file exactly reflects the last sync outcome” and producing consumers acting on an inverted health signal?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Alternates success and failure each period. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: DeleteErrorFile() and writeContent() race, leaving a stale error visible after a successful sync or no error after a failure
- Invariant to test: the error file exactly reflects the last sync outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: consumers acting on an inverted health signal (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: assert --error-file and --touch-file writes never follow a symlink and never leave residue after a successful sync
