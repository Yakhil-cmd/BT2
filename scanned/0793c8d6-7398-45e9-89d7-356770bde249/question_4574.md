# Q4574: add-user-scaled-debt via repay: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `repay` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `add-user-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
