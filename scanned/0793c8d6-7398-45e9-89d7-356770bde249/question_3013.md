# Q3013: mask-to-list-iter via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) — which appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `mask-to-list-iter` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
