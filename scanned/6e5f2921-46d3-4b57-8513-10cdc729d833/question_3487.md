# Q3487: query or topic reuse via signed user flow that on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `LocationToAccountId` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
