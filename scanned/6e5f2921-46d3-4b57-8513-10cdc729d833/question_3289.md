# Q3289: proxy-batched broker escape via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `burn_at_relay` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `burn_at_relay`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
