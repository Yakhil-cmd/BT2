# Q1110: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - num_cells not upper-bounded via Python [a-3-item-batch-containing-two-byte-ident]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass a num_cells far above CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB and drive the input_size / calloc arithmetic in the challenge toward overflow (a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
- Invariant to test: allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps (input: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
