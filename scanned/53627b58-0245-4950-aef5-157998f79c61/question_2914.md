# Q2914: identity-deposit drift via proxy proxy multisig as on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on People Kusama runtime and control identity fields, username state, sub-account lists, and deposits packed into one signed flow so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: identity fields, username state, sub-account lists, and deposits packed into one signed flow
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over identity fields, usernames, and accompanying asset transitions
