# Q1916: next-index via collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order varied, and assert that the value `next-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
