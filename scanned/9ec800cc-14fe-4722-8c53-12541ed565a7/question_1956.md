# Q1956: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via assethubpolkadot signed user path on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `LocationToAccountId` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
