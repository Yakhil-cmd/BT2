# Q3946: stake-ratio ordering edge via staking payout stakers and on Relay common payout logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::payout_stakers` and era transition user paths on Relay common payout logic and control reward-payout timing around large stake movement, nomination-pool movement, or unlock boundaries so that `relay_era_payout` causes `relay_era_payout` to drift from the balances users and the treasury can actually realize, breaking the invariant that staking payout plus treasury rest must remain bounded by the intended issuance schedule, and leading to high - system-wide accounting error in staking payout?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/common/src/lib.rs` :: `relay_era_payout`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::payout_stakers` and era transition user paths
- Attacker controls: reward-payout timing around large stake movement, nomination-pool movement, or unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: causes `relay_era_payout` to drift from the balances users and the treasury can actually realize
- Invariant to test: staking payout plus treasury rest must remain bounded by the intended issuance schedule
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - system-wide accounting error in staking payout
- Fast validation: property test over realistic staking-state ranges and ordering paths with payout bound assertions
