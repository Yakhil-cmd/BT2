# Q2056: queue-finalization replay via proxy proxy multisig as on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` causes inbound, outbound, relayer-reward, and XCM routing state to disagree about which message or beneficiary was finalized, breaking the invariant that one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: causes inbound, outbound, relayer-reward, and XCM routing state to disagree about which message or beneficiary was finalized
- Invariant to test: one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
