# Q4774: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
