# Q4392: resolve-interpolation-points via liquidate: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `liquidate` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `collateral-receiver` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `resolve-interpolation-points` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
