# Q870: verify_kzg_proof - pairing-side/negation error via Python [a-48-byte-string-with-the-infinity-flag]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: pairings_verify)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: find inputs where g1_sub/g2_sub or pairings_verify negation makes a false claim balance (a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate).
- Invariant to test: *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery (input: a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate).
