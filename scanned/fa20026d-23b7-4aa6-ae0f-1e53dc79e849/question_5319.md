# Q5319: next-liquidity-index via repay: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `repay` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
