# Q3726: increment via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), can an unprivileged attacker make `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `increment` advances the user-id nonce, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `increment` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
