# Q4887: is-liquidation-paused via liquidate: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`is-liquidation-paused` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691) returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `borrower`, any third-party principal, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691` -> `is-liquidation-paused`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `is-liquidation-paused` returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Reach it through `liquidate` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `is-liquidation-paused` touches, run `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
