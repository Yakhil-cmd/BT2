# Q5639: calc-treasury-lp-preview via accrue: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `accrue` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
