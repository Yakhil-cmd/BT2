# Q1444: fee-conversion inconsistency via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
