# Q3608: offline-payment double-spend via runtimecall encointercommunities signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCommunities` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes community balances, treasuries, and reputation state disagree about which value was already spent or earned, breaking the invariant that batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules, and leading to critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCommunities` signed user path
- Attacker controls: offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes community balances, treasuries, and reputation state disagree about which value was already spent or earned
- Invariant to test: batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
