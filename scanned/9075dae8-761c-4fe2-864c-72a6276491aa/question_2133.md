# Q2133: bridge-settlement mismatch via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control relayer-beneficiary choices, bridge message ordering, and queue occupancy shaped by valid user bridge actions so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: relayer-beneficiary choices, bridge message ordering, and queue occupancy shaped by valid user bridge actions
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
