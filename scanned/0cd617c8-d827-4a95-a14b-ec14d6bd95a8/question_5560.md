# Q5560: collateral-add via collateral-remove: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
