# Q0315: touch — ready latch stale under shared volume

## Question
Does touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state stay safe when an attacker makes every sync after the first fail (deleted ref, stalled remote, wedged repo) in a shared volume read by a co-tenant container — or can setRepoReady() has already latched true, so `/` keeps returning 200 while the served tree ages indefinitely, violating “readiness reflects the freshness of the published data, not merely that one sync once succeeded” and producing silent staleness: consumers and orchestration believe data is current when it is not?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Makes every sync after the first fail (deleted ref, stalled remote, wedged repo). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: setRepoReady() has already latched true, so `/` keeps returning 200 while the served tree ages indefinitely
- Invariant to test: readiness reflects the freshness of the published data, not merely that one sync once succeeded
- Expected Immunefi impact: silent staleness: consumers and orchestration believe data is current when it is not (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: curl the bound port from an unauthorized context and assert nothing sensitive (argv, profiles, counters) is returned
