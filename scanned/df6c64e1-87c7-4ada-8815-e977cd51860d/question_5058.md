# Q5058: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - r derivable before proofs are chosen via Elixir [a-128-cell-batch-all-mapped-to-one-colum]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check the transcript in compute_r_powers hashes commitments/z/y/proofs so r cannot be predicted then gamed (a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column).
- Invariant to test: r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r (input: a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column).
