# Q2512: get-liquidation-position via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
