# Q3805: mempool stale checked tx under amount boundary channel provenance

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through RPC CheckTx or InsertTx followed by commit and proposal by controlling same-sender txs, sequence, fees, balances and bridge/conversion messages when the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid, then keep stale checked txs after account state changes and execute invalid fund movement so that only txs valid against current committed state can enter blocks fails and IBC channel, packet, and denom trace identity cannot be attacker-selected or replayed, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: app/mempool/manager.go::RecheckTxs
- Entrypoint: RPC CheckTx or InsertTx followed by commit and proposal
- Attacker controls: same-sender txs, sequence, fees, balances and bridge/conversion messages; scenario focus: amount boundary plus channel provenance.
- Exploit idea: keep stale checked txs after account state changes and execute invalid fund movement while the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid.
- Invariant to test: only txs valid against current committed state can enter blocks; also verify IBC channel, packet, and denom trace identity cannot be attacker-selected or replayed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: write a focused unit test around the named function and assert pre/post bank, module, and contract balances.
