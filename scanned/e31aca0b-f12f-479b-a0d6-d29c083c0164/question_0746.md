# Q746: message-export route confusion via xcmpallet teleport assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
