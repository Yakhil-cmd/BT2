# Q1559: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
