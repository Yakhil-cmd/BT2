# Q4523: recoverCellsAndKzgProofs - cell-index stride into roots_of_unity via Nim [an-ascending-list-with-one-column-index]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs (used by Nimbus)` with an ascending list with one column index repeated later, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that every roots_of_unity index < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB+1 so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an ascending list with one column index repeated later. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: probe missing_cell_indices[i]*stride indexing into roots_of_unity for an out-of-range access (an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
- Invariant to test: every roots_of_unity index < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB+1.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: every roots_of_unity index < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB+1 (input: an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
