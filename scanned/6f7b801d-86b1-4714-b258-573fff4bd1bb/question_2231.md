# Q2231: ComputeKzgProof - canonical y_out serialization via CSharp [r-1-largest-canonical-scalar]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with r-1 (largest canonical scalar), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z) so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_kzg_proof (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: r-1 (largest canonical scalar). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bytes_from_bls_field emits the canonical y for boundary field values (r-1 (largest canonical scalar)).
- Invariant to test: y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z) (input: r-1 (largest canonical scalar)).
