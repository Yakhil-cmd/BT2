# Q1725: increment via liquidate-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) — which advances the user-id nonce — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `increment` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
