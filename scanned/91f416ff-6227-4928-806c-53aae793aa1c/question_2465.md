# Q2465: preimage-deposit drift via proxy proxy multisig as on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control batched combinations of proxy, preimage, referenda, and XCM execution so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}` makes open user submission paths disagree with later dispatch, deposit, or cleanup logic about what was authorized, breaking the invariant that preimage and referendum-related deposits must be debited, refunded, and consumed exactly once, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misrouting of deposits tied to collective flows?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: batched combinations of proxy, preimage, referenda, and XCM execution
- Exploit idea: makes open user submission paths disagree with later dispatch, deposit, or cleanup logic about what was authorized
- Invariant to test: preimage and referendum-related deposits must be debited, refunded, and consumed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misrouting of deposits tied to collective flows
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over preimage, submit, schedule, and cleanup ordering
