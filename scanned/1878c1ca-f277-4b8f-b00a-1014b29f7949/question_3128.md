# Q3128: create_account mishandles duplicate/aliased accounts (system_processor.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `create_account` in `programs/system/src/system_processor.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and have `create_account` read a stale copy of an account passed twice in the same instruction, so that the invariant "Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `programs/system/src/system_processor.rs` -> `create_account()` (around line 150)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Pass the same account at two indices so `create_account` reads a stale copy and writes back a value computed from it, duplicating or erasing a balance.
- Invariant to test: Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Unit test the path with the same pubkey at two indices; assert the final lamports match the single-reference case.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
