# Q1508: fee-conversion inconsistency via assets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
