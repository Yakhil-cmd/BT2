# Q787: cross-pallet hold mismatch via nominationpools join bond extra on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
