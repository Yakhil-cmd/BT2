# Q721: blob_to_kzg_commitment - identity-point encoding of a commitment via C [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the 48 output bytes == the spec's compressed identity encoding, matching other clients so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: bytes_from_g1)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose commitment is the identity and confirm bytes_from_g1 serializes it exactly as the spec expects (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: the 48 output bytes == the spec's compressed identity encoding, matching other clients.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: the 48 output bytes == the spec's compressed identity encoding, matching other clients (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
