# Q4322: lookup via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `lookup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
