# Q2542: VerifyBlobKZGProof - challenge transcript match via Go [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the verify-side compute_challenge transcript equals the prove-side and the spec (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
