# Q2072: queue-finalization replay via assethubpolkadot signed bridge frontend on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over message ordering, beneficiary choice, and queue state with one-settlement assertions
