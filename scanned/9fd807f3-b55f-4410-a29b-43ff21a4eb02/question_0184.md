# Q184: reserve-release ordering via utility batch all around on Asset Hub operations pallet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple `AhOps` calls on Asset Hub operations pallet and control the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow so that `Pallet::withdraw_crowdloan_contribution` makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping, breaking the invariant that reserve release, contribution withdrawal, and treasury transfer must reconcile exactly with the remaining backing state, and leading to high - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/ah-ops/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::withdraw_crowdloan_contribution`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple `AhOps` calls
- Attacker controls: the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow
- Exploit idea: makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping
- Invariant to test: reserve release, contribution withdrawal, and treasury transfer must reconcile exactly with the remaining backing state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over repeated withdraw/unreserve ordering with reserve and balance assertions
