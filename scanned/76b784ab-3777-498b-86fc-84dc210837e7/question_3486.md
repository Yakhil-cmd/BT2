# Q3486: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - batch equals per-item single verify via Java [an-empty-batch-n-0]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with an empty batch (n == 0), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch verdict == AND of verify_blob_kzg_proof over the same triples, for every n so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an empty batch (n == 0). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify each triple alone and as a batch and require identical verdicts (an empty batch (n == 0)).
- Invariant to test: batch verdict == AND of verify_blob_kzg_proof over the same triples, for every n.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: batch verdict == AND of verify_blob_kzg_proof over the same triples, for every n (input: an empty batch (n == 0)).
