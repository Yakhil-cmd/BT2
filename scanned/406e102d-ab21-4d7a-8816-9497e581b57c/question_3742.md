# Q3742: rpc-state via getPubKey 3742

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the RTK query cache update in `getPubKey` (packages/api/src/wallets/DID.ts) control out-of-order event and query responses during a pending modal confirmation and drive the sequence validate input -> normalize payload -> call RPC so the GUI would mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/wallets/DID.ts` / `getPubKey`
- Entrypoint: RTK query cache update
- Attacker controls: out-of-order event and query responses; during a pending modal confirmation
- Exploit idea: mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: exercise the Electron IPC or WalletConnect command handler with crafted params and assert approval classification is strict
