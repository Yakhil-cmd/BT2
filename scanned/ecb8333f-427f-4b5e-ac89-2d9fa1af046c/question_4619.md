# Q4619: accrue-collateral-asset via redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `recipient`, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
