# Q1705: finish_combine_ancient_slots_packed_internal settles one authorization twice (ancient_append_vecs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `finish_combine_ancient_slots_packed_internal` in `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and have `finish_combine_ancient_slots_packed_internal` apply the same authorized effect a second time, so that the invariant "One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` -> `finish_combine_ancient_slots_packed_internal()` (around line 724)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Get `finish_combine_ancient_slots_packed_internal` to apply the same logical effect twice from a single user authorization by re-entering it or replaying the surrounding flow.
- Invariant to test: One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit the flow twice (and once re-entrantly) and assert the second application is rejected and balances moved once.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can claim, double-claim, or redirect epoch rewards, commission, or collected fees belonging to another stake or vote account.
