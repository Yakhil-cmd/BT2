# Q0978: resolve-dia via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
