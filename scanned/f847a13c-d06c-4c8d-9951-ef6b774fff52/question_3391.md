# Q3391: accrue-collateral-asset via liquidate: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, then read `accrue-collateral-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
