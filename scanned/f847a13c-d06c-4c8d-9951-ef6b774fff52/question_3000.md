# Q3000: merge-price via collateral-remove: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
