# Q0714: get-cached-indexes via accrue: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `accrue` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `get-cached-indexes` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
