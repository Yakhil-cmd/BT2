# Q5376: debt-add-scaled via liquidate-multi: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `debt-add-scaled` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
