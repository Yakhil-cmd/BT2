# Q3841: query-state replay on payout via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value, breaking the invariant that one treasury payout must map to one remote transfer and one final beneficiary, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper
- Exploit idea: lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value
- Invariant to test: one treasury payout must map to one remote transfer and one final beneficiary
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
