# Q2364: lookup via borrow: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `borrow` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `lookup` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
