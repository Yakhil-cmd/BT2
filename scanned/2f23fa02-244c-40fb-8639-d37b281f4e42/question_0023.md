# Q0023: active via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
