# Q3692: SSRF to internal addresses - EnableRepoOverride in repo_override.go

## Question
Can a URL derived from attacker-published data reaching `EnableRepoOverride` in [pkg/cmdutil/repo_override.go](pkg/cmdutil/repo_override.go#L36) point at localhost, link-local (169.254.169.254), or an internal host, causing the victim's gh (often in CI) to fetch and surface internal data?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmdutil/repo_override.go:36](pkg/cmdutil/repo_override.go#L36) - `EnableRepoOverride`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated command against attacker-influenced coordinates (gh api, gh pr list, gh repo view -R ...)
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Publish an asset/codespace/skill URL pointing at the CI metadata service.
- Invariant to test: Only public, allowlisted hosts are fetched; literal IP and localhost targets are rejected.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Arbitrary local file read / private data exfiltrated to an attacker-visible destination
- Fast validation: Table test over internal targets asserting rejection.
