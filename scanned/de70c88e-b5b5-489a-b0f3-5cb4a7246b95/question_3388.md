# Q3388: Reuse helper output under new signer set

## Question
Can a single malicious participant or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `confidential_key_derivation::ckd(...)` and carry a previously valid `invert` helper output into a different participant set or threshold context where `invert` still accepts it, leading to Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability?

## Target
- File/function: `src/confidential_key_derivation/ciphersuite.rs::invert`
- Entrypoint: `confidential_key_derivation::ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `scalar`, `Self`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Port helper output from one threshold or participant set into another flow that should have rejected it.
- Invariant to test: Helper outputs for `invert` must be invalid outside their original participant and threshold context.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `confidential_key_derivation::ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `invert` data into `invert`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
