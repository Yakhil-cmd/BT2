# Q4399: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - cell-batch r predictable before proofs via Java [a-batch-whose-proofs-are-permuted-relati]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge binds commitments, indices, cells and proofs so r cannot be gamed (a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
- Invariant to test: r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known (input: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
