# Q3183: Reuse helper output under new signer set

## Question
Can a single malicious participant or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `confidential_key_derivation::ckd(...)` and carry a previously valid `big_y` helper output into a different participant set or threshold context where `deserialize` still accepts it, leading to Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability?

## Target
- File/function: `src/confidential_key_derivation/app_id.rs::deserialize`
- Entrypoint: `confidential_key_derivation::ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `deserializer`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Port helper output from one threshold or participant set into another flow that should have rejected it.
- Invariant to test: Helper outputs for `big_y` must be invalid outside their original participant and threshold context.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `confidential_key_derivation::ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `big_y` data into `deserialize`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
