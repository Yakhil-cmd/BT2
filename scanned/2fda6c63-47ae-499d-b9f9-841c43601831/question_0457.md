# Q0457: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate-multi: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) — which takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down` — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `calc-liq-debt-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
