# Q390: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - cell-batch r predictable before proofs via Elixir [a-2-item-batch-where-item-0-is-valid-and]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge binds commitments, indices, cells and proofs so r cannot be gamed (a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged).
- Invariant to test: r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known (input: a 2-item batch where item 0 is valid and item 1 is forged).
