# Q0587: find-superset via collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
