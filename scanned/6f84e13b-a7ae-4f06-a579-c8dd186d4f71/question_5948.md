# Q5948: iter-lookup-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `iter-lookup-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
