# Q1242: system-repay via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `system-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
