# Q1750: reserve-backed asset confusion via assetconversion create pool add on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
