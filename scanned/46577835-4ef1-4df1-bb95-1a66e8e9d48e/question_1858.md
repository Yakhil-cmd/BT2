# Q1858: safe-call filter mismatch via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `TrustedAliasers` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedAliasers`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
