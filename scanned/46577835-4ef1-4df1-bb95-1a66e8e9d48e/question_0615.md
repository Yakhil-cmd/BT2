# Q615: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet teleport assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / Aliasers` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
