# Q2514: preimage-deposit drift via polkadotxcm execute on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control batched combinations of proxy, preimage, referenda, and XCM execution so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}` creates a path where a signed user indirectly reaches a more privileged origin or wider call surface than intended, breaking the invariant that XCM-assisted execution must not strand or duplicate collective-related funds, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misrouting of deposits tied to collective flows?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: batched combinations of proxy, preimage, referenda, and XCM execution
- Exploit idea: creates a path where a signed user indirectly reaches a more privileged origin or wider call surface than intended
- Invariant to test: XCM-assisted execution must not strand or duplicate collective-related funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misrouting of deposits tied to collective flows
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over preimage, submit, schedule, and cleanup ordering
