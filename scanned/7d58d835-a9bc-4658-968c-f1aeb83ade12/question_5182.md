# Q5182: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - commitment-index map collision via Java [cell-index-128-cells-per-ext-blob-one-pa]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: exploit commitment_indices from deduplicate_commitments so a cell is weighted against the wrong commitment (cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
- Invariant to test: cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one (input: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
