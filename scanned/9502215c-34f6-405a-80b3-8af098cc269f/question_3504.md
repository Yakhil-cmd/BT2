# Q3504: Mismatch commitment and share

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and pair a valid-looking `channel tag` with a different `waitpoint` reveal so `get` checks each piece in isolation but never the combined statement, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::get`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `item`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Commit to one `channel tag` and reveal another `waitpoint` that still satisfies separate local checks.
- Invariant to test: A commitment and its corresponding `channel tag` reveal must be validated as the same statement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `channel tag` data into `get`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
