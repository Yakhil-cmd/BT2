# Q3869: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - proof bit-reversal ordering via Python [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof k == the reference proof for cell k so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bit_reversal_permutation)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bit_reversal_permutation on proofs matches cell ordering and the spec (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: proof k == the reference proof for cell k.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: proof k == the reference proof for cell k (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
