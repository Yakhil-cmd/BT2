# Q3331: burn-accounting drift via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries so that `burn_at_relay` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `burn_at_relay`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
