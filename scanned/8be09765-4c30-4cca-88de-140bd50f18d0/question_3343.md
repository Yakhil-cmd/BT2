# Q3343: burn-accounting drift via proxy proxy multisig as on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls on Coretime Kusama runtime and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
