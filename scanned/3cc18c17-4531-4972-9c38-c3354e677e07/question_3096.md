# Q3096: population via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it counts set bits to order the bucket search, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `population` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
