# Q1227: asset-converter split-brain via polkadotxcm execute on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape so that `FeeManager` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
