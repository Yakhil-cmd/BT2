# Q803: cross-pallet hold mismatch via nominationpools join bond extra on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
