# Q2906: slash-routing confusion via polkadotxcm execute send on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Kusama runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` reuses or reorders user-controlled identity state so a deposit, refund, or lock is consumed twice or never released, breaking the invariant that identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: reuses or reorders user-controlled identity state so a deposit, refund, or lock is consumed twice or never released
- Invariant to test: identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over identity fields, usernames, and accompanying asset transitions
