# Q2931: slash-routing confusion via proxy proxy multisig as on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on People Kusama runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` creates a path where identity-related state changes and asset-moving calls disagree about the effective owner or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: creates a path where identity-related state changes and asset-moving calls disagree about the effective owner or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
