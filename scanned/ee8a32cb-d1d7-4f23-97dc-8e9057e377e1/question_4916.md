# Q4916: create via collateral-remove: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) varied, and assert that the value `create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
