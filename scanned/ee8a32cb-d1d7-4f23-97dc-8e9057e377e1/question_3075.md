# Q3075: zip via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `zip` touches, run `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
