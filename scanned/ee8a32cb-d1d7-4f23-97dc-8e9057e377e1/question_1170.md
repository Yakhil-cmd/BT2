# Q1170: remove-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
