# Q4927: [legacy sha1 signature header] `membership` action=`added` -> MembershipHandler on a review_stacks_enabled false stack

## Question
Combining the `legacy sha1 signature header` verification gap (attacker supplies `X-Hub-Signature: sha1=...` (the only algorithm `verify_webhook_signature` accepts) rather than the modern `X-Hub-Signature-256`) with a `membership` action=`added` event against a victim stack where review_stacks_enabled false, can an unprivileged attacker make `MembershipHandler` (creates/finds a `Team` by `params.team.id` and a `User` by `params.member.login` then adds or removes the membership rows that `User#authorized?` reads) cause impact because review stacks are supposedly disabled yet the provision? precedence bug still provisions?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/membership_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `membership` body action=`added`, signature/headers; supplies `X-Hub-Signature: sha1=...` (the only algorithm `verify_webhook_signature` accepts) rather than the modern `X-Hub-Signature-256`; victim stack has review_stacks_enabled false
- Exploit idea: the code path that could reject a forged body depends on an algorithm/secret combination the attacker can sidestep for a no-secret org; `MembershipHandler` creates/finds a `Team` by `params.team.id` and a `User` by `params.member.login` then adds or removes the membership rows that `User#authorized?` reads; review stacks are supposedly disabled yet the provision? precedence bug still provisions amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `membership` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of review_stacks_enabled false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Remote Code Execution on the Shipit deploy host (HackerOne/Immunefi RCE class)
- Fast validation: minitest: under `legacy sha1 signature header`, forge `membership` action=`added` for a review_stacks_enabled false stack, assert the downstream effect.
