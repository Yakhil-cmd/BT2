# Q3064: username-expiry accounting drift via proxy proxy utility batch on People Kusama identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Kusama identity config and control username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls so that `IdentityAdminOrigin` creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated, breaking the invariant that username and sub-account lifecycle state must not strand or duplicate user funds, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityAdminOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls
- Exploit idea: creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated
- Invariant to test: username and sub-account lifecycle state must not strand or duplicate user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
