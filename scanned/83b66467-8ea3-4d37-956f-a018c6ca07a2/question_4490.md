# Q4490: Webhook.Do — webhook timeout pileup under shared volume

## Question
Does Webhook.Do(): the `Gitsync-Hash` header, success-status check, and unbounded response-body read stay safe when an attacker makes the webhook endpoint stall just under --webhook-timeout every time in a shared volume where hook output lands next to consumer data — or can hook goroutines and retries accumulate against a frozen endpoint, violating “hook concurrency is bounded” and producing resource exhaustion / denial of updates?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/hook/webhook.go](pkg/hook/webhook.go) — `Webhook.Do`
- Entrypoint: attacker push -> hook fired after (or before) publish with the new hash and worktree path
- Attacker controls: Makes the webhook endpoint stall just under --webhook-timeout every time. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: hook goroutines and retries accumulate against a frozen endpoint
- Invariant to test: hook concurrency is bounded
- Expected Immunefi impact: resource exhaustion / denial of updates (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: assert the hook's environment carries no credential material and its cwd is a git-sync-created worktree
