# Q4622: compute_kzg_proof - fr_batch_inv on a zero denominator via Python [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.compute_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that no proof is returned when any inversion input is zero; out is never used after a BADARGS so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_kzg_proof (helper: fr_batch_inv)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.compute_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft inputs so a denominator (w_i - z) is zero and check fr_batch_inv returns C_KZG_BADARGS without emitting a bogus proof (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: no proof is returned when any inversion input is zero; out is never used after a BADARGS.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: no proof is returned when any inversion input is zero; out is never used after a BADARGS (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
