# Q118: proxy-type widening via multisig as multi remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
