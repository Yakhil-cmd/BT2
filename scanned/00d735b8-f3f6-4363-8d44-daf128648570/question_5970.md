# Q5970: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - deduplicate_commitments compares bytes not points via Zig [two-distinct-byte-strings-a-client-belie]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply two commitment encodings a client thinks are equal/unequal and see if deduplicate_commitments splits or merges them wrongly (two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference (input: two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment).
