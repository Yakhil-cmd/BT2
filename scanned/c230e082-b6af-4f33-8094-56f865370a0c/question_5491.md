# Q5491: ComputeCellsAndKZGProofs - emitted cell proofs self-verify via Go [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.ComputeCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.ComputeCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch accepts the (commitment,index,cell,proof) tuples this function emits (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
