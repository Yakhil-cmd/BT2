# Q922: shard trie mixup in shard_tries::get_trie_with_block_hash_for_shard

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who drives cross-shard traffic from many attacker-funded accounts on different shards, controlling state operations spanning the shard boundary after a layout change, drive `core/store/src/trie/shard_tries.rs::get_trie_with_block_hash_for_shard` to read or write another shard's trie state, breaking the invariant that every shard only ever touches state belonging to its own key range, and leading to unauthorized state modification of an account the attacker does not control?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/shard_tries.rs` -> `get_trie_with_block_hash_for_shard`
- Entrypoint: unprivileged attacker drives cross-shard traffic from many attacker-funded accounts on different shards
- Attacker controls: state operations spanning the shard boundary after a layout change
- Exploit idea: read or write another shard's trie state
- Invariant to test: every shard only ever touches state belonging to its own key range
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized state modification of an account the attacker does not control
- Fast validation: write a multi-shard `test-loop-tests` scenario and assert every shard keeps producing chunks and all receipts drain
