# Q2967: safe-call filter mismatch via peoplekusama pallet xcm send on People Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeopleKusama::pallet_xcm::send` on People Kusama XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `PeopleKusama::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
