# Q2630: identity-deposit drift via polkadotxcm execute send on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Polkadot runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that identity deposits and refunds must always reconcile with the final asset balances, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: identity deposits and refunds must always reconcile with the final asset balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or proxy test if the path depends on aliased locations or nested execution
