# Q624: origin-conversion mismatch via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `LocalOriginConverter` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
