# Q2933: proxy-assisted identity escape via proxy proxy multisig as on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on People Kusama runtime and control XCM beneficiaries, aliasable locations, and identity-related slashing or refund conditions so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that signed users must never reach registrar or admin-like effects through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: XCM beneficiaries, aliasable locations, and identity-related slashing or refund conditions
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: signed users must never reach registrar or admin-like effects through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
