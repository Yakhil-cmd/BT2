# Q3033: parse_memo confuses account types or owners (parse_instruction.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `parse_memo` in `transaction-status/src/parse_instruction.rs` with integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates, and have `parse_memo` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`parse_memo` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-status/src/parse_instruction.rs` -> `parse_memo()` (around line 132)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `parse_memo` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `parse_memo` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `parse_memo` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
