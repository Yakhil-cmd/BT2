# Q5983: repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs — config race first sync under shared volume

## Question
Does SetupDefaultGitConfigs(): gc.autoDetach=false, gc.pruneExpire=now, credential.helper=cache, core.askPass=true written to the private GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL stay safe when an attacker starts pushing before SetupExtraGitConfigs() finishes on first start in a shared --root volume writable by a co-tenant — or can a fetch runs under partially applied configuration, violating “no sync starts before configuration is complete” and producing sync performed without intended safety settings?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs`
- Entrypoint: attacker-committed config-bearing content -> git invocations that read the effective config
- Attacker controls: Starts pushing before SetupExtraGitConfigs() finishes on first start. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: a fetch runs under partially applied configuration
- Invariant to test: no sync starts before configuration is complete
- Expected Immunefi impact: sync performed without intended safety settings (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: sync the fixture and assert no repo-supplied config layer changed transport, alias, hook, or credential behaviour
