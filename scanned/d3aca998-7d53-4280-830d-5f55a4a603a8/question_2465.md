# Q2465: debt-add-scaled via collateral-remove: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) — which stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
