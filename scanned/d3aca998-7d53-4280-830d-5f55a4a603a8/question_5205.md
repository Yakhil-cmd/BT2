# Q5205: accrue-user-debts via deposit: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, drive `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) — which folds accrual over the position's debt list only — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `deposit` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-debts` touches, run `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
