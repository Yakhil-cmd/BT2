# Q1626: verify_kzg_proof - accept an infinity proof via Elixir [an-on-curve-point-outside-the-order-r-g1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok == true iff the pairing relation holds; an infinity proof must not verify a false claim so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: verify_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass the point at infinity as the proof and a y/z that makes the pairing trivially balance (an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup).
- Invariant to test: *ok == true iff the pairing relation holds; an infinity proof must not verify a false claim.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: *ok == true iff the pairing relation holds; an infinity proof must not verify a false claim (input: an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup).
