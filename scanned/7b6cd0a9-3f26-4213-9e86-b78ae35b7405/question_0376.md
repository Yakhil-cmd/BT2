# Q0376: new_without_scheduler can be driven into unbounded work (installed_scheduler_pool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `new_without_scheduler` in `runtime/src/installed_scheduler_pool.rs` with a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority, and make `new_without_scheduler` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `new_without_scheduler` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/installed_scheduler_pool.rs` -> `new_without_scheduler()` (around line 401)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `new_without_scheduler` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `new_without_scheduler` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `new_without_scheduler` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
