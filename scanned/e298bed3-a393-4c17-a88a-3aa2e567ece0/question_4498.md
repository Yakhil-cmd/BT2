# Q4498: write-feed via collateral-remove-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `min-underlying`, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
