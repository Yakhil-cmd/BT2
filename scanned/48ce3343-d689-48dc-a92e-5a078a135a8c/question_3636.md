# Q3636: add-user-collateral via liquidate: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `add-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
