# Q4394: ref name starting with a dash - New in default.go

## Question
Does `New` in [pkg/cmd/factory/default.go](pkg/cmd/factory/default.go#L26) place a branch/ref/tag name from remote data in a git argv position where a leading `-` becomes an option (e.g. `--upload-pack=`)?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:26](pkg/cmd/factory/default.go#L26) - `New`
- Entrypoint: gh factory default
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Publish a PR branch or tag named `--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn`.
- Invariant to test: Ref values are validated against git's ref format and always follow `--`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Remote code execution on the victim's developer machine (GitHub Bug Bounty: RCE in gh; Immunefi 'Websites and Apps' class: arbitrary code execution)
- Fast validation: Table test with hostile ref names asserting rejection or correct positioning.
