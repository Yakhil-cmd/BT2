# Q2633: sub-account lock reuse via polkadotxcm execute send on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Polkadot runtime and control XCM beneficiaries, aliasable locations, and identity-related slashing or refund conditions so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, Assets, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that identity deposits and refunds must always reconcile with the final asset balances, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, Assets, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: XCM beneficiaries, aliasable locations, and identity-related slashing or refund conditions
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: identity deposits and refunds must always reconcile with the final asset balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over identity fields, usernames, and accompanying asset transitions
