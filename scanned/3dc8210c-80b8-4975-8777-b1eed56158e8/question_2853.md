# Q2853: calc-index-next via redeem: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `redeem` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
