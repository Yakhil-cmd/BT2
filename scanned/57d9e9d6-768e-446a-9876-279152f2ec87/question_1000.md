# Q1000: unlock-ordering mismatch via xcmpallet execute send limited on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
