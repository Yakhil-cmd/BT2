# Q838: EIP-4844 parsing gas floor gap at blob-style fee field decoding

## Question
Can an attacker use `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-4844 transaction path so that blob-style fee field decoding enforces too little work relative to the real execution path, enabling underpriced execution that drains relayer or protocol balances and causes Theft of gas?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_4844.rs` -> `blob-style fee field decoding`
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-4844 transaction path
- Attacker controls: typed transaction bytes, blob-related fee fields, calldata, recipient/create choice, signature values, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: undercharge work by targeting the floor or intrinsic-gas assumption baked into the subtarget.
- Invariant to test: EIP-4844 parsing must not let blob-style fee or envelope fields desynchronize gas accounting from execution intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft of gas
- Fast validation: Measure actual work against charged gas on crafted calldata and access-list sizes, then assert no path underpays for execution. add parser tests plus local execution tests that mutate typed-envelope and fee fields and check sender, fee charge, refund, and resulting state
