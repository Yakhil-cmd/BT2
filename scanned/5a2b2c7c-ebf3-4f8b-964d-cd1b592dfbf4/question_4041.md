# Q4041: tenant/subdomain matching - fetchDraftRelease in fetch.go

## Question
Does `fetchDraftRelease` in [pkg/cmd/release/shared/fetch.go](pkg/cmd/release/shared/fetch.go#L246) classify any `*.ghe.com`/`*.github.com` style subdomain as trusted, letting an attacker-registered tenant host receive the victim's requests or token?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/release/shared/fetch.go:246](pkg/cmd/release/shared/fetch.go#L246) - `fetchDraftRelease`
- Entrypoint: gh release
- Attacker controls: an asset, artifact, gist, or archive-member name and its bytes
- Exploit idea: Register or point gh at a lookalike tenant host and observe the credential decision.
- Invariant to test: Tenant matching validates the exact configured tenant, not an arbitrary subdomain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Exfiltration of the victim's GitHub OAuth token / git credentials to an attacker-controlled host (sensitive credential disclosure)
- Fast validation: Test with an unexpected tenant hostname asserting no token is attached.
