# Q2360: connector ft and storage methods resource exhaustion seeded by one-yocto checks on transfer and storage exits

## Question
Can an attacker use `ft_transfer()`, `ft_transfer_call()`, `storage_deposit()`, `storage_unregister()`, and `storage_withdraw()` on the Aurora engine contract so that one-yocto checks on transfer and storage exits keeps creating state, promises, or registrations that the protocol must later pay to maintain, eventually causing Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/connector.rs::ft_transfer / ft_transfer_call / storage_* / return_promise` -> `one-yocto checks on transfer and storage exits`
- Entrypoint: `ft_transfer()`, `ft_transfer_call()`, `storage_deposit()`, `storage_unregister()`, and `storage_withdraw()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: JSON transfer and storage arguments, attached deposit, attached 1 yocto where required, target account IDs, and repeated request ordering
- Exploit idea: look for unbounded public resource creation rooted in the targeted connector step.
- Invariant to test: proxy methods into the NEAR-side connector must preserve exactly one intended account, amount, memo/message, and attached-balance meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run a high-count local sequence and measure whether protocol-held storage, registration state, or required connector balance grows without safe user-paid bounds. write integration tests that inspect generated promise payloads and balances for transfer and storage calls under crafted JSON arguments and deposit values
