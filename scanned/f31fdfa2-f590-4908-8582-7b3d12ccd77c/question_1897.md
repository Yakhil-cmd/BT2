# Q1897: get-cached-indexes via redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling `recipient`, drive `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) — which reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with `recipient`, then read `get-cached-indexes` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
