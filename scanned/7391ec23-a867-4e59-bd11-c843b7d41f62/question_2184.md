# Q2184: remove-user-scaled-debt via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `remove-user-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
