# Q5747: calc-utilization via repay: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `repay` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
