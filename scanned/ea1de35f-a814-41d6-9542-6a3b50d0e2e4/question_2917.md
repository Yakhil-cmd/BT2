# Q2917: repoSync.fetch — filter fallback blowup under first sync

## Question
Under the very first sync after container start, when the root is empty and syncCount is 0, an attacker pushes objects that the server cannot serve under the configured --filter (e.g. blobs the partial-clone filter cannot skip). In the argv assembled in fetch() (`fetch <repo> <ref> --verbose --no-progress --prune --no-auto-gc` plus --depth/--unshallow/--filter), can that mean the `--filter` fetch degrades to a full object transfer that the volume was never sized for, so that the invariant “partial-clone filtering bounds transferred bytes regardless of what the remote holds” no longer holds and the outcome is volume exhaustion / node disk pressure denial of service?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.fetch`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Pushes objects that the server cannot serve under the configured --filter (e.g. blobs the partial-clone filter cannot skip). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: the `--filter` fetch degrades to a full object transfer that the volume was never sized for
- Invariant to test: partial-clone filtering bounds transferred bytes regardless of what the remote holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: volume exhaustion / node disk pressure denial of service (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: stand up a local bare repo (file:// or `git daemon`), reproduce the ref/object shape, run git-sync for two periods and diff `readlink <link>` against the ref's real tip
