# Q762: unlock-ordering mismatch via nominationpools join bond extra on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
