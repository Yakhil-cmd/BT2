# Q2071: reward-beneficiary confusion via bridgerelayers signed stake or on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
