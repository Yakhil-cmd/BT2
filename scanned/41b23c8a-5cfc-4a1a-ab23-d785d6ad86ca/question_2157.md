# Q2157: rpc-state via getKeys 2157

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the WebSocket event subscription in `getKeys` (packages/gui/src/electron/api/getKeys.ts) control response object with duplicate camelCase/snake_case keys through a batch of rapid user-accessible actions and drive the sequence connect -> approve -> switch context -> execute so the GUI would correlate a command response to the wrong pending request, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/gui/src/electron/api/getKeys.ts` / `getKeys`
- Entrypoint: WebSocket event subscription
- Attacker controls: response object with duplicate camelCase/snake_case keys; through a batch of rapid user-accessible actions
- Exploit idea: correlate a command response to the wrong pending request
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: mock remote fetch responses before and after preview and assert the submit path revalidates identity-critical fields
