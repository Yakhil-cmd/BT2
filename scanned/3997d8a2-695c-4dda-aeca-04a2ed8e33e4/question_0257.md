# Q257: submit_with_args() log filter mismatch after access list conversion before execution

## Question
Can an attacker make access list conversion before execution emit logs or promise markers that the engine filters differently from the committed state, letting external systems or callbacks act on the wrong interpretation and eventually causing Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::submit_with_args -> engine/src/engine.rs::submit_with_alt_modexp` -> `access list conversion before execution`
- Entrypoint: `submit_with_args()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: borsh-encoded `SubmitArgs`, raw transaction bytes inside `SubmitArgs`, optional max gas price overrides, relayer account choice, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: exploit disagreement between emitted logs/promise markers and committed value movement around the subtarget.
- Invariant to test: the structured submit path must preserve the same signer, fee, authorization, and refund semantics as the raw submit path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Capture raw logs and filtered logs for crafted transactions and confirm they cannot imply value movement different from committed state. write a Rust integration test that sends equivalent transactions through `submit()` and `submit_with_args()`, mutates the targeted field, and checks balances, nonce, logs, and status parity
