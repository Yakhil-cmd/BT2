# Q632: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - cells+proofs differ across precompute via Rust [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference cell-proofs for the blob regardless of precompute so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute cells and proofs with precompute 0 vs 8 and require identical bytes (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference cell-proofs for the blob regardless of precompute.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference cell-proofs for the blob regardless of precompute (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
