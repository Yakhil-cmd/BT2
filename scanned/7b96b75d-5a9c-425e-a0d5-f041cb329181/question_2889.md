# Q2889: identity-deposit drift via polkadotxcm execute send on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Kusama runtime and control identity fields, username state, sub-account lists, and deposits packed into one signed flow so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: identity fields, username state, sub-account lists, and deposits packed into one signed flow
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or proxy test if the path depends on aliased locations or nested execution
