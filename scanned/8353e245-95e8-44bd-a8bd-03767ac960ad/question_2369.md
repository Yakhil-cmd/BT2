# Q2369: resolve via collateral-remove: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) — which selects the efficiency group for a position mask — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
