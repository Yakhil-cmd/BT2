# Q2305: blobToKzgCommitment - commitment via the zero-point filter in g1_lincomb_fast via Zig [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.blobToKzgCommitment via root.zig` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: g1_lincomb_fast)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.blobToKzgCommitment via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply a blob so that g1_lincomb_fast's `blst_p1_is_inf` filter drops coefficients and yields the identity commitment while the polynomial is non-zero (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
