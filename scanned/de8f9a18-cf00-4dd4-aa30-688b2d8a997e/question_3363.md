# Q3363: burn-accounting drift via proxy proxy multisig as on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls on Coretime Kusama runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
