# Q2859: linear-interpolate via collateral-remove-redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `linear-interpolate` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
