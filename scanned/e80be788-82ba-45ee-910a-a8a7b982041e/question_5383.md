# Q5383: principal-ratio-reduction via deposit: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `recipient`, including a contract principal, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `deposit` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, then read `principal-ratio-reduction` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
