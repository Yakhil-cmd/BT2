# Q896: double-withdraw edge via xcmpallet execute send limited on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
