# Q0881: send-underlying via accrue: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, drive `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) — which pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `accrue` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
