# Q3414: proxy-batched broker escape via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Kusama runtime and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
