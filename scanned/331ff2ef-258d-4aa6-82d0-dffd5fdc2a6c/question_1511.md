# Q1511: swap-settlement mismatch via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
