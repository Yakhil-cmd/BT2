# Q1680: fee-conversion inconsistency via foreignassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
