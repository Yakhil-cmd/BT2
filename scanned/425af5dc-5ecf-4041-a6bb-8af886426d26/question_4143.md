# Q4143: receive-tokens via liquidate-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) pulls an asset from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `receive-tokens` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
