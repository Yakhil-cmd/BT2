# Q2539: relayer precompile signer binding under failed tail call cross-phase equality

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through EVM relayer precompile call with marshaled Cosmos message by controlling protobuf bytes, signer field, EVM caller and method selector when a later bank, EVM, IBC, or callback step fails after earlier fund-sensitive work has run, then make signer extraction authenticate caller while message moves another account funds so that precompile caller exactly equals the value-moving message signer fails and CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: x/cronos/keeper/precompiles/utils.go::exec
- Entrypoint: EVM relayer precompile call with marshaled Cosmos message
- Attacker controls: protobuf bytes, signer field, EVM caller and method selector; scenario focus: failed tail call plus cross-phase equality.
- Exploit idea: make signer extraction authenticate caller while message moves another account funds while a later bank, EVM, IBC, or callback step fails after earlier fund-sensitive work has run.
- Invariant to test: precompile caller exactly equals the value-moving message signer; also verify CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: use a malicious minimal EVM contract or marshaled protobuf payload to exercise the entrypoint and inspect all state diffs.
