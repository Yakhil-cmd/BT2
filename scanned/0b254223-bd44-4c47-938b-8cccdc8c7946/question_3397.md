# Q3397: vault-accrue via deposit: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, drive `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) — which dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `deposit` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, then read `vault-accrue` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
