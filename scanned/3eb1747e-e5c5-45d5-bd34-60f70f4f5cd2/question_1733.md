# Q1733: migration-balance drift via poolassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
