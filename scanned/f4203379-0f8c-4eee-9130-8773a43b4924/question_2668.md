# Q2668: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - C_minus_y / r_times_z indexing via Zig [a-single-item-batch-n-1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with a single-item batch (n == 1), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a single-item batch (n == 1). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: look for an index or ordering error between C_minus_y[i], r_times_z[i] and r_powers[i] (a single-item batch (n == 1)).
- Invariant to test: entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index (input: a single-item batch (n == 1)).
