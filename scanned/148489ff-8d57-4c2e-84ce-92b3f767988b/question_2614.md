# Q2614: refund-beneficiary mismatch via proxy proxy multisig as on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on People Polkadot runtime and control asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds, breaking the invariant that identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds
- Invariant to test: identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or proxy test if the path depends on aliased locations or nested execution
