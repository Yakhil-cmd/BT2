# Q812: claim-path state divergence via claims claim claim attest on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
