# Q1290: message-export route confusion via polkadotxcm limited reserve transfer on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `TrustedAliasers` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedAliasers`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
