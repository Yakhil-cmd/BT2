# Q3144: revenue-claim replay via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
