# Q3827: remote-transfer success drift via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout hel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper so that `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote` lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper
- Exploit idea: lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
