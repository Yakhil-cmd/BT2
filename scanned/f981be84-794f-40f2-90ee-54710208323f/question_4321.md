# Q4321: repoSync.fetch — empty repo first sync under onetime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who makes the remote ref exist but point at an empty tree on the very first sync, under `--one-time` mode, where the process must exit with a status after a single sync, reach a state where — in the argv assembled in fetch() (`fetch <repo> <ref> --verbose --no-progress --prune --no-auto-gc` plus --depth/--unshallow/--filter) — initRepo()/sanityCheckRepo() treat the resulting root as invalid and wipe it, or a zero-file worktree is published as ready, breaking the invariant that an empty publish is never reported as a successful, ready sync and yielding consumers served an empty dataset while readiness reports success?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.fetch`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Makes the remote ref exist but point at an empty tree on the very first sync. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: initRepo()/sanityCheckRepo() treat the resulting root as invalid and wipe it, or a zero-file worktree is published as ready
- Invariant to test: an empty publish is never reported as a successful, ready sync
- Expected Immunefi impact: consumers served an empty dataset while readiness reports success (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: unit-test the resolution path with a fixture repo and assert the resolved hash equals `git rev-parse <ref>` on the server
