# Q2759: relayer acknowledgement refund under replay attempt cross-phase equality

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through EVM call to relayer acknowledgement(bytes) by controlling MsgAcknowledgement bytes, ack result, proof, sender and sequence when the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback, then replay or forge acknowledgement so refunds or callbacks credit the wrong party so that ack processing authenticates packet identity and pays at most once fails and CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: x/cronos/keeper/precompiles/relayer.go::Run Acknowledgement
- Entrypoint: EVM call to relayer acknowledgement(bytes)
- Attacker controls: MsgAcknowledgement bytes, ack result, proof, sender and sequence; scenario focus: replay attempt plus cross-phase equality.
- Exploit idea: replay or forge acknowledgement so refunds or callbacks credit the wrong party while the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback.
- Invariant to test: ack processing authenticates packet identity and pays at most once; also verify CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: use a malicious minimal EVM contract or marshaled protobuf payload to exercise the entrypoint and inspect all state diffs.
