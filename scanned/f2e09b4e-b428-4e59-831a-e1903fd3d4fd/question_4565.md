# Q4565: write-feed via collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) — which applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
