# Q1758: reserve-backed asset confusion via assets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
