# Q1589: migration-balance drift via polkadotxcm send execute transfer on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
