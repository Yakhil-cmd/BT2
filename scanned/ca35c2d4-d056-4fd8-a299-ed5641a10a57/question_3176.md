# Q3176: calc-final-liquidation-amounts via liquidate: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834` -> `calc-final-liquidation-amounts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Reach it through `liquidate` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
