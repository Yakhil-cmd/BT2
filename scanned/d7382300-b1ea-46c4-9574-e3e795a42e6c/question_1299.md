# Q1299: deploy_code() serialization roundtrip break in deployment input forwarding into `deploy_code_with_input`

## Question
Can an attacker craft an input that survives one serialization or normalization roundtrip through deployment input forwarding into `deploy_code_with_input` but changes meaning on the next roundtrip, so the engine violates contract deployment must charge and commit exactly once, derive the correct address, and never leave half-deployed state behind and leads to Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::deploy_code -> engine/src/engine.rs::deploy_code_with_input / deploy_code` -> `deployment input forwarding into `deploy_code_with_input``
- Entrypoint: `deploy_code()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: deployment bytecode, constructor input, repeated deployment timing, and any address constraints reachable through the entry path
- Exploit idea: abuse a non-idempotent parse/serialize cycle around the targeted component.
- Invariant to test: contract deployment must charge and commit exactly once, derive the correct address, and never leave half-deployed state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Roundtrip the targeted structure through parse and serialization repeatedly and assert the resulting execution intent and fee semantics remain unchanged. write a Rust integration test that deploys crafted bytecode through `deploy_code()`, then checks address derivation, code storage, logs, balances, and revert handling
