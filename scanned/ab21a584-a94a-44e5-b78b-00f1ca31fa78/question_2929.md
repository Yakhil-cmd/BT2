# Q2929: rpc-state via batchUpdate 2929

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the service command response correlation in `batchUpdate` (packages/api/src/wallets/DL.ts) control RPC error payload shaped like success with hidden Unicode characters and drive the sequence validate input -> normalize payload -> call RPC so the GUI would poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/wallets/DL.ts` / `batchUpdate`
- Entrypoint: service command response correlation
- Attacker controls: RPC error payload shaped like success; with hidden Unicode characters
- Exploit idea: poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: mock remote fetch responses before and after preview and assert the submit path revalidates identity-critical fields
