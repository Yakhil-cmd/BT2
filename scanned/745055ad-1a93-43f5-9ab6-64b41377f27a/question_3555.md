# Q3555: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing call ordering within the block, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-to-list-collateral` touches, run `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
