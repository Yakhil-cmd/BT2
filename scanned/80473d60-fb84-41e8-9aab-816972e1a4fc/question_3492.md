# Q3492: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via coretimekusama pallet xcm execute on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
