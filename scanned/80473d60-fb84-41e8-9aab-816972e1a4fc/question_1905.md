# Q1905: beneficiary resolution split via assethubpolkadot signed user path on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
