# Q3022: sub-account deposit leak via identity set identity clear on People Kusama identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Kusama identity config and control username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls so that `IdentityAdminOrigin` makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination, breaking the invariant that identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityAdminOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls
- Exploit idea: makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination
- Invariant to test: identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test for repeated identity mutation with balance assertions before and after refund/slash
