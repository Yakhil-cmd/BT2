# Q2173: bridge-fee swap drift via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config` replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match, breaking the invariant that front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match
- Invariant to test: front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
