# Q4383: collateral-remove via supply-collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `collateral-remove` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
