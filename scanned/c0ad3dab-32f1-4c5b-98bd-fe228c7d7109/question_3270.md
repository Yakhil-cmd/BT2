# Q3270: burn-accounting drift via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `BurnCoretimeRevenue` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `BurnCoretimeRevenue`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
