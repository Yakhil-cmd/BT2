# Q108: stale proof replay via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::remote_proxy` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control multiple registered proofs whose LIFO consumption order can be attacker-shaped through nested dispatch so that `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::remote_proxy`
- Attacker controls: multiple registered proofs whose LIFO consumption order can be attacker-shaped through nested dispatch
- Exploit idea: resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: nested batch and multisig test asserting exactly which proof is popped and which call consumes it
