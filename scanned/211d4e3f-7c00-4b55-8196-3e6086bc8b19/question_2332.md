# Q2332: linear-interpolate via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
