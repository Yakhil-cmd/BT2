# Q0237: calc-final-liquidation-amounts via liquidate-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834) — which recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834` -> `calc-final-liquidation-amounts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
