# Q5283: RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs - all-cells-missing edge case via CSharp [cell-index-128-cells-per-ext-blob-one-pa]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the edge case returns BADARGS, never an out-of-range roots_of_unity read so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: drive vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells toward len_missing >= CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
- Invariant to test: the edge case returns BADARGS, never an out-of-range roots_of_unity read.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: the edge case returns BADARGS, never an out-of-range roots_of_unity read (input: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
