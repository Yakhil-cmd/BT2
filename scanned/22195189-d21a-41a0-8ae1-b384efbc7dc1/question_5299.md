# Q5299: calculate-asset-notional-value via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `calculate-asset-notional-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
