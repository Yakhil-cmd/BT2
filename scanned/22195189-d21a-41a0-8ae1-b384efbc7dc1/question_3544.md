# Q3544: write-feed via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
