# Q3876: alias collision on execution via signed user flow that on Bulletin Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Bulletin through valid upstream XCM` on Bulletin Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `Barrier` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bulletin/bulletin-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Bulletin through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
