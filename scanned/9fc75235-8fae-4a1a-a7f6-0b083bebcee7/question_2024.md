# Q2024: send-tokens via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
