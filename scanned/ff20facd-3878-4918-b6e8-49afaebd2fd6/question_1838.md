# Q1838: Snowbridge export bypass via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `MessageExporter` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `MessageExporter`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
