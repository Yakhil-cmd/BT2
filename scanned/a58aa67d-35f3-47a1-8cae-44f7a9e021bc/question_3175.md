# Q3175: votes_offset can be driven into unbounded work (frame_v1_14_11.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `votes_offset` in `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v1_14_11.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and make `votes_offset` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `votes_offset` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v1_14_11.rs` -> `votes_offset()` (around line 72)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `votes_offset` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `votes_offset` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `votes_offset` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
