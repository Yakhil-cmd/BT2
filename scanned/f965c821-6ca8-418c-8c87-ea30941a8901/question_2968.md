# Q2968: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
