# Q4727: blob_to_kzg_commitment - commitment determinism vs the bit-reversed Lagrange setup via Rust [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::blob_to_kzg_commitment (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitment bytes == the reference spec commitment for the same blob on every build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: poly_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::blob_to_kzg_commitment (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check blob_to_kzg_commitment maps blob positions to g1_values_lagrange_brp identically on every node/precompute (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: commitment bytes == the reference spec commitment for the same blob on every build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_blob_to_kzg_commitment.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: commitment bytes == the reference spec commitment for the same blob on every build (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
