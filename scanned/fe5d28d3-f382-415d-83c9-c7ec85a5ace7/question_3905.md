# Q3905: blocked address value movement under amount boundary channel provenance

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation by controlling tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix when the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid, then bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction so that blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings fails and IBC channel, packet, and denom trace identity cannot be attacker-selected or replayed, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: app/proposal.go::ValidateTransaction
- Entrypoint: PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation
- Attacker controls: tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix; scenario focus: amount boundary plus channel provenance.
- Exploit idea: bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction while the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid.
- Invariant to test: blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings; also verify IBC channel, packet, and denom trace identity cannot be attacker-selected or replayed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: write a focused unit test around the named function and assert pre/post bank, module, and contract balances.
