# Q4296: get-account-scaled-debt via borrow: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it reads one scaled debt row, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `borrow` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `get-account-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
