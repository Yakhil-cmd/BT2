# Q0957: as_sanitized_transaction confuses account types or owners (sdk_transactions.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `as_sanitized_transaction` in `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/sdk_transactions.rs` with a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count, and have `as_sanitized_transaction` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`as_sanitized_transaction` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/sdk_transactions.rs` -> `as_sanitized_transaction()` (around line 139)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `as_sanitized_transaction` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `as_sanitized_transaction` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `as_sanitized_transaction` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
