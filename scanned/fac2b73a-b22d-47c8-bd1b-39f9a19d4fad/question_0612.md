# Q612: fee-asset undercharge path via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `FeeManager / Aliasers` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
