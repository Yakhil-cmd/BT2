# Q515: beneficiary resolution split via xcmpallet limited reserve transfer on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `Barrier` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
