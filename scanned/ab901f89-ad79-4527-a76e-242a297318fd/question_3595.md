# Q3595: Validate same bytes under two meanings

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and submit the same raw `private channel` bytes under two semantic interpretations so `private_channel` accepts both paths even though only one should be valid, leading to Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::private_channel`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `from`, `to`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Submit identical raw bytes for `private channel` under two semantic interpretations and test whether both verification paths accept them.
- Invariant to test: The same `private channel` bytes must not validate under multiple semantic domains, roles, or curve/group interpretations.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `private channel` data into `private_channel`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
