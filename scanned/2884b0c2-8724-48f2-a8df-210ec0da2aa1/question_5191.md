# Q5191: population via liquidate: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) counts set bits to order the bucket search. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `liquidate` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `population` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
