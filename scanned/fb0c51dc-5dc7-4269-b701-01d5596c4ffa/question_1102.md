# Q1102: EIP-7702 parsing partial-failure replay around normalization of authorization data into engine execution

## Question
Can an attacker use `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-7702 transaction with typed transaction bytes, authorization list entries, calldata, fees, signature values, and relayer timing to push normalization of authorization data into engine execution through a partial-failure path, then replay or retry the same user-intent so one branch keeps side effects while the retry reuses the original value or nonce budget, leading to Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_7702.rs` -> `normalization of authorization data into engine execution`
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-7702 transaction
- Attacker controls: typed transaction bytes, authorization list entries, calldata, fees, signature values, and relayer timing
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure or retry boundary so the targeted transaction component is observed twice under inconsistent state.
- Invariant to test: EIP-7702 authorization and delegated-account handling must not bypass sender, code, nonce, or fee invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Drive one call into a controlled revert or async failure edge, replay the same request, and assert balance, nonce, and relayer reward remain single-applied. add tests that vary authorization-list content and sender code state, then assert `RejectCallerWithCode`, nonce, fees, and execution all stay aligned
