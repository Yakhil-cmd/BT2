# Q1293: deploy_code() status-state split after deployment input forwarding into `deploy_code_with_input`

## Question
Can an attacker make deployment input forwarding into `deploy_code_with_input` return a status that looks like a clean failure while state, logs, or refunds have already moved in a way that can be exploited for Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::deploy_code -> engine/src/engine.rs::deploy_code_with_input / deploy_code` -> `deployment input forwarding into `deploy_code_with_input``
- Entrypoint: `deploy_code()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: deployment bytecode, constructor input, repeated deployment timing, and any address constraints reachable through the entry path
- Exploit idea: force a divergence between the reported transaction status and the actual state side effects after the named subtarget.
- Invariant to test: contract deployment must charge and commit exactly once, derive the correct address, and never leave half-deployed state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Compare returned `SubmitResult.status` with balances, logs, and storage after crafted reverts and fatal exits. write a Rust integration test that deploys crafted bytecode through `deploy_code()`, then checks address derivation, code storage, logs, balances, and revert handling
