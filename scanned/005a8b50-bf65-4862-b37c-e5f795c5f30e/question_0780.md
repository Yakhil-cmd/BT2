# Q780: claim-path state divergence via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
