# Q3464: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate-redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault whose share price the redemption moves reach `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the vault whose share price the redemption moves varied, and assert that the value `calc-liquidation-params` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
