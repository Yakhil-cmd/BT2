# Q2619: lookup via collateral-remove: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `lookup` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
