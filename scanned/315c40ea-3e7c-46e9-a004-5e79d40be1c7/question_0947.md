# Q947: proxy-batch privilege widening via staking bond unbond rebond on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}`
- Attacker controls: nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions
- Exploit idea: makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
