# Q51: account-mapping collision via multisig as multi remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control multiple registered proofs whose LIFO consumption order can be attacker-shaped through nested dispatch so that `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof
- Attacker controls: multiple registered proofs whose LIFO consumption order can be attacker-shaped through nested dispatch
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: nested batch and multisig test asserting exactly which proof is popped and which call consumes it
