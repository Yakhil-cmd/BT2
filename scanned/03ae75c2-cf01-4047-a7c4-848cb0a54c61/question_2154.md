# Q2154: bridge-path availability wedge via assethubpolkadot signed bridge frontend on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
