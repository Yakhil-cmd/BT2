# Q5740: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
