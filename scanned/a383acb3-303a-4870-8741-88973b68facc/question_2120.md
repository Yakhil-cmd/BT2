# Q2120: get-notional-evaluation via borrow: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `borrow` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `get-notional-evaluation` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
