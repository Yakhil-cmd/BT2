# Q5843: get-full-position via collateral-remove: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
