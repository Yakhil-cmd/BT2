# Q2517: convert-to-assets-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), drive `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) — which prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview` — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-assets-preview` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
