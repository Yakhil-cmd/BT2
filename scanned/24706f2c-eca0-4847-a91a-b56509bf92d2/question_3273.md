# Q3273: repoSync.SetupGitSSH — redacturl parse gap under http basic

## Question
Under HTTPS auth with `--username` and `$GITSYNC_PASSWORD`, an attacker supplies repo-adjacent URLs that `url.Parse` fails on (scp-like `user:pass@host:path`) into any logged path. In SetupGitSSH()'s `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND` string building, SetupCookieFile(), and the redaction helpers redactURL()/logSafeFlags(), can that mean redactURL() returns the string unchanged, printing the password into logs and the error file, so that the invariant “every logged URL is redacted regardless of form” no longer holds and the outcome is credential disclosure via logs readable by the co-tenant?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupGitSSH / SetupCookieFile / redactURL / logSafeFlags`
- Entrypoint: attacker-controlled repo content or redirect target -> refreshCreds()/credential helper during the sync
- Attacker controls: Supplies repo-adjacent URLs that `url.Parse` fails on (scp-like `user:pass@host:path`) into any logged path. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: redactURL() returns the string unchanged, printing the password into logs and the error file
- Invariant to test: every logged URL is redacted regardless of form
- Expected Immunefi impact: credential disclosure via logs readable by the co-tenant (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: grep logs and --error-file after the failure path and assert no secret or secret-derived value appears
