# Q2442: collective-origin widening via proxy proxy multisig as on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control batched combinations of proxy, preimage, referenda, and XCM execution so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` induces a state where execution succeeds but deposit, refund, or scheduling state remains inconsistent, breaking the invariant that preimage and referendum-related deposits must be debited, refunded, and consumed exactly once, and leading to high - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: batched combinations of proxy, preimage, referenda, and XCM execution
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but deposit, refund, or scheduling state remains inconsistent
- Invariant to test: preimage and referendum-related deposits must be debited, refunded, and consumed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over batched proxy/XCM/preimage combinations
