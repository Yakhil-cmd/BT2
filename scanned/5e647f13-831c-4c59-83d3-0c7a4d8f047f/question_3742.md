# Q3742: zip via collateral-remove-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
