# Q3596: debt-add-scaled via collateral-remove-redeem: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `debt-add-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
