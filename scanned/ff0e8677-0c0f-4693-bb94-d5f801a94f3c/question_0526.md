# Q526: computeBlobKzgProof - challenge transcript layout in compute_challenge via NodeJs [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.computeBlobKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.computeBlobKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm compute_challenge hashes FSBLOBVERIFY_V1_ | 0 | FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB | blob | commitment in exactly the spec's byte order and widths (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
