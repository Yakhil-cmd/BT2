# Q3333: resolve-dia via liquidate-multi: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) — which derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-dia` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
