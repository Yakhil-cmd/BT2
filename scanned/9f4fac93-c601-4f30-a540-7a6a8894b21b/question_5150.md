# Q5150: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - infinity cell proof filtered from the lincomb via Rust [a-point-whose-compression-is-accepted-by]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a point whose compression is accepted by blst_p1_uncompress but is not in G1, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok true iff every proof opens its cell; a filtered infinity proof cannot pass so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: g1_lincomb_fast)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a point whose compression is accepted by blst_p1_uncompress but is not in G1. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: include a proof that is the point at infinity so g1_lincomb_fast drops it while its r^i weight still scales the commitment side (a point whose compression is accepted by blst_p1_uncompress but is not in G1).
- Invariant to test: *ok true iff every proof opens its cell; a filtered infinity proof cannot pass.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: *ok true iff every proof opens its cell; a filtered infinity proof cannot pass (input: a point whose compression is accepted by blst_p1_uncompress but is not in G1).
