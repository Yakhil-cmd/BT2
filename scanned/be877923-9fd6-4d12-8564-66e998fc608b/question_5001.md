# Q5001: repoSync.SetupGitSSH — credential append order under github app

## Question
Under GitHub App auth with `--github-app-*` flags, an attacker relies on the precedence between --credential entries and the --repo-derived credential. In SetupGitSSH()'s `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND` string building, SetupCookieFile(), and the redaction helpers redactURL()/logSafeFlags(), can that mean the wrong credential is matched for the fetch and a credential is offered to an unintended URL, so that the invariant “credential precedence is deterministic and scoped” no longer holds and the outcome is credential disclosure to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupGitSSH / SetupCookieFile / redactURL / logSafeFlags`
- Entrypoint: attacker-controlled repo content or redirect target -> refreshCreds()/credential helper during the sync
- Attacker controls: Relies on the precedence between --credential entries and the --repo-derived credential. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: the wrong credential is matched for the fetch and a credential is offered to an unintended URL
- Invariant to test: credential precedence is deterministic and scoped
- Expected Immunefi impact: credential disclosure to an unintended host (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: run a local auth endpoint / fixture remote that records what it receives and assert no credential reaches any host but the configured one
