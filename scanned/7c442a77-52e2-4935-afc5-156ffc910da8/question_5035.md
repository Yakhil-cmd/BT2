# Q5035: create via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, then read `create` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
