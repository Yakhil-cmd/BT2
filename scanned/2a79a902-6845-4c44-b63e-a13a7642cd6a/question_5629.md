# Q5629: resolve-dia via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling call ordering within the block, drive `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) — which derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, then read `resolve-dia` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
