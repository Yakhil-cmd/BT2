# Q1816: Snowbridge export bypass via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an export path that can target `XcmOverBridgeHubKusama`, `SnowbridgeExporterV2`, or legacy `SnowbridgeExporter` so that `FeeManager / WaivedLocations` makes `DenyExportMessageFrom`, `MessageExporter` ordering, or `LocationAsSuperuser` disagree with the origin and destination the runtime actually uses, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / WaivedLocations`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: an export path that can target `XcmOverBridgeHubKusama`, `SnowbridgeExporterV2`, or legacy `SnowbridgeExporter`
- Exploit idea: makes `DenyExportMessageFrom`, `MessageExporter` ordering, or `LocationAsSuperuser` disagree with the origin and destination the runtime actually uses
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
