# Q1715: proxy-batched asset escape via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
