# Q213: VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch - infinity commitment inside a batch via Go [the-compressed-point-at-infinity-0xc0-th]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch true iff every triple's pairing holds, infinity commitment included so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: include a triple whose commitment is the point at infinity and see if aggregation accepts it (the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
- Invariant to test: batch true iff every triple's pairing holds, infinity commitment included.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: batch true iff every triple's pairing holds, infinity commitment included (input: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
