# Q628: waived-execution bypass via xcmpallet transfer assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::transfer_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `LocalOriginConverter` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
