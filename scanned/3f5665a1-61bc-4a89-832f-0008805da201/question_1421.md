# Q1421: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via polkadotxcm teleport assets on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
