# Q3840: fee-asset settlement mismatch via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
