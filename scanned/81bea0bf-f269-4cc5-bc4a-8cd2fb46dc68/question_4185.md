# Q4185: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) — which routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-socialize-debt` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
