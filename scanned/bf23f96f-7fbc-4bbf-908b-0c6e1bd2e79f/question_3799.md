# Q3799: remote-transfer success drift via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout hel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper so that `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset location, beneficiary conversion, and payment-status replay
