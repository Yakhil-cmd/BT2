# Q3599: rpc-state via index 3599

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the service command response correlation in `index` (packages/api/src/constants/index.ts) control large numeric fields near JS precision limits with conflicting localStorage preferences and drive the sequence import -> parse -> preview -> submit so the GUI would mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/constants/index.ts` / `index`
- Entrypoint: service command response correlation
- Attacker controls: large numeric fields near JS precision limits; with conflicting localStorage preferences
- Exploit idea: mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: mock the service layer and assert no RPC call is made unless displayed and submitted fields match
