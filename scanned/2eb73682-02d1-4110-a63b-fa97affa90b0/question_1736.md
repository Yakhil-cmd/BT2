# Q1736: fee-conversion inconsistency via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
