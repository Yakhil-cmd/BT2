# Q3773: query-state replay on payout via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout help

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper so that `TransferOverXcm::transfer` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::transfer`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
