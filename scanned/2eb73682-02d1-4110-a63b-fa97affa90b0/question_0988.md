# Q988: pool-versus-staking split via staking bond unbond rebond on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
