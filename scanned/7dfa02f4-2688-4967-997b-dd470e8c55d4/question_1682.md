# Q1682: approval or proof replay via polkadotxcm send execute transfer on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
