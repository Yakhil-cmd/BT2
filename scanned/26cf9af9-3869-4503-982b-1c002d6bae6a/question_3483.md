# Q3483: origin-conversion mismatch via signed user flow that on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `Barrier` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
