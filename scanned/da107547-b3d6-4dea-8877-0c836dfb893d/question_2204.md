# Q2204: wrong-asset bridge settlement via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control swap slippage and pool-state manipulation around fee conversion into the configured Ethereum fee asset so that `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2` makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: swap slippage and pool-state manipulation around fee conversion into the configured Ethereum fee asset
- Exploit idea: makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
