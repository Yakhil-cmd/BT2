# Q3390: proxy-batched broker escape via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama runtime and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
