# Q1862: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - C_minus_y / r_times_z indexing via NodeJs [a-64-item-batch-with-exactly-one-crafted]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: look for an index or ordering error between C_minus_y[i], r_times_z[i] and r_powers[i] (a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
- Invariant to test: entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index (input: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
