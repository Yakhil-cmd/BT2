# Q243: crowdloan-withdraw replay via ahops unreserve crowdloan reserve on Asset Hub operations pallet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve` on Asset Hub operations pallet and control the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow so that `Pallet::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve` makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping, breaking the invariant that migration-related account translation helpers must not enable value movement to the wrong sovereign account, and leading to high - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/ah-ops/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve`
- Attacker controls: the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow
- Exploit idea: makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping
- Invariant to test: migration-related account translation helpers must not enable value movement to the wrong sovereign account
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over repeated withdraw/unreserve ordering with reserve and balance assertions
