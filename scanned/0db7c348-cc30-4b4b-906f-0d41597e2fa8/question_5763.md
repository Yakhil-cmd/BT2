# Q5763: response used to overwrite local config - NewExternalHTTPClient in http_client.go

## Question
Can data returned through `NewExternalHTTPClient` in [api/http_client.go](api/http_client.go#L100) be written into gh's own configuration (default host, aliases, editor, browser) without validation?

## Target
- File/function: [api/http_client.go:100](api/http_client.go#L100) - `NewExternalHTTPClient`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated command against attacker-influenced coordinates (gh api, gh pr list, gh repo view -R ...)
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Return a crafted object whose field is persisted locally.
- Invariant to test: Persisted config values come from user input, not from responses.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Remote code execution on the victim's developer machine (GitHub Bug Bounty: RCE in gh; Immunefi 'Websites and Apps' class: arbitrary code execution)
- Fast validation: Test asserting no config write results from a hostile response.
