# Q927: Equivocate per recipient

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and send recipient-specific `child channel` variants into `recv` so different honest parties bind different views of `child channel` yet still converge on an accepted downstream output, leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::recv`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `header`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Feed different `child channel` values to different honest parties and test whether `child channel` still converges without detection.
- Invariant to test: All honest parties must observe one consistent `child channel` / `child channel` transcript for the same round.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `child channel` data into `recv`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
