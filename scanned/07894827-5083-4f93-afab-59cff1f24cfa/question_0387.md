# Q0387: send-underlying via redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `min-out`, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `send-underlying` touches, run `redeem` with `min-out`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
