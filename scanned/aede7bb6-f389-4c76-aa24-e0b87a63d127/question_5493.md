# Q5493: oracle-last-update via collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) — which returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `oracle-last-update` touches, run `collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
