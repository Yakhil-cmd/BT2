# Q4928: linear-interpolate via deposit: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient`, including a contract principal reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `deposit` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with `recipient`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
