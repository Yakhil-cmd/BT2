# Q2017: iter-find-superset via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) — which short-circuits on the first superset match — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `iter-find-superset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
