# Q2386: mask-update via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94` -> `mask-update`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
