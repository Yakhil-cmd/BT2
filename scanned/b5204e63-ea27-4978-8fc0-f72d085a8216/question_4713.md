# Q4713: blobToKzgCommitment - commitment via the zero-point filter in g1_lincomb_fast via Nim [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.blobToKzgCommitment (used by Nimbus)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: g1_lincomb_fast)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.blobToKzgCommitment (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply a blob so that g1_lincomb_fast's `blst_p1_is_inf` filter drops coefficients and yields the identity commitment while the polynomial is non-zero (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
