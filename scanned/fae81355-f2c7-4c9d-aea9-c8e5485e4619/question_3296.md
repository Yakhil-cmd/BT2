# Q3296: interpolate-rate via repay: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `repay` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `interpolate-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
