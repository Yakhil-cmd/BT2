# Q1002: active via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `active` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
