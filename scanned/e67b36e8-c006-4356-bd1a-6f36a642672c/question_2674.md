# Q2674: query or topic reuse via peoplepolkadot pallet xcm send on People Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` on People Polkadot XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `Barrier` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
