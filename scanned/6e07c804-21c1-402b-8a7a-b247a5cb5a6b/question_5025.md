# Q5025: find-debt-scaled via liquidate-multi: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-debt-scaled` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
