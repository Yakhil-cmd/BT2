# Q0903: next-liquidity-index via deposit: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `recipient`, including a contract principal, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `deposit` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
