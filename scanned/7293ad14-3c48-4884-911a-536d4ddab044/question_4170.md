# Q4170: VerifyBlobKzgProof - non-canonical blob element in verify via CSharp [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: blob_to_polynomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in the blob and confirm blob_to_polynomial rejects before pairing (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
