# Q3958: blocked address value movement under replay attempt rollback safety

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation by controlling tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix when the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback, then bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction so that blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings fails and failed callbacks, failed module calls, and failed packet flows leave no profitable residue, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: app/proposal.go::ValidateTransaction
- Entrypoint: PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation
- Attacker controls: tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix; scenario focus: replay attempt plus rollback safety.
- Exploit idea: bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction while the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback.
- Invariant to test: blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings; also verify failed callbacks, failed module calls, and failed packet flows leave no profitable residue.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: replay the same transaction sequence from exported genesis and assert deterministic balances and mappings. Scoped to live HackenProof Cronos Blockchain Protocols: cryptographic flaws and vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds; excludes DoS/DDoS/spam, gas draining, leaked keys, privileged-address/admin abuse, basic governance attacks, known fork/dependency issues without a working Cronos PoC, tests, mocks, scripts, docs, disabled configs, and non-production code.
