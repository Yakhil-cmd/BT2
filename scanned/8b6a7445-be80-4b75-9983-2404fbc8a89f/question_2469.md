# Q2469: assume_exclusive_mutating_thread arithmetic overflows on reachable values (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `assume_exclusive_mutating_thread` in `unified-scheduler-logic/src/lib.rs` with amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates, and make the arithmetic in `assume_exclusive_mutating_thread` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `unified-scheduler-logic/src/lib.rs` -> `assume_exclusive_mutating_thread()` (around line 315)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `assume_exclusive_mutating_thread` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `assume_exclusive_mutating_thread` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
