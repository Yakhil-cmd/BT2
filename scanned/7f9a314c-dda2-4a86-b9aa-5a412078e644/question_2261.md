# Q2261: ComputeCellsAndKzgProofs - proof bit-reversal ordering via CSharp [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof k == the reference proof for cell k so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bit_reversal_permutation)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bit_reversal_permutation on proofs matches cell ordering and the spec (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: proof k == the reference proof for cell k.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: proof k == the reference proof for cell k (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
