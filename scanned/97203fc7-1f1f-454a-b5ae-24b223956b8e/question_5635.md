# Q5635: verifyKzgProof - accept an infinity proof via Java [two-distinct-byte-strings-a-client-belie]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyKzgProof via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok == true iff the pairing relation holds; an infinity proof must not verify a false claim so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: verify_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyKzgProof via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass the point at infinity as the proof and a y/z that makes the pairing trivially balance (two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: *ok == true iff the pairing relation holds; an infinity proof must not verify a false claim.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: *ok == true iff the pairing relation holds; an infinity proof must not verify a false claim (input: two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment).
