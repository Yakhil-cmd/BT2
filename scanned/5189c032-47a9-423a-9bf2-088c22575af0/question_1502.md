# Q1502: add-user-collateral via liquidate-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the vault whose share price the redemption moves varied, and assert that the value `add-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
