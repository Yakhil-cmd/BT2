# Q3160: revenue-claim replay via proxy proxy multisig as on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
