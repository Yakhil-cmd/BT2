# Q1125: safe-call filter mismatch via polkadotxcm limited reserve transfer on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `TrustedAliasers` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedAliasers`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
