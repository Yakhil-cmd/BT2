# Q0680: increment via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
