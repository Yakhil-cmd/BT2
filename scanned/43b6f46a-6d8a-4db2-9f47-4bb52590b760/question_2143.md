# Q2143: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate-multi: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the full batch list and its ordering, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `vault-socialize-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
