# Q2516: preimage-deposit drift via preimage note preimage unnote on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Preimage::{note_preimage, unnote_preimage}` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control XCM messages and beneficiaries that interact with the same balance or scheduling state so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}` creates a path where a signed user indirectly reaches a more privileged origin or wider call surface than intended, breaking the invariant that signed users must not escalate into privileged collective execution through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged execution with direct user or treasury loss?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}`
- Entrypoint: `Preimage::{note_preimage, unnote_preimage}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages and beneficiaries that interact with the same balance or scheduling state
- Exploit idea: creates a path where a signed user indirectly reaches a more privileged origin or wider call surface than intended
- Invariant to test: signed users must not escalate into privileged collective execution through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged execution with direct user or treasury loss
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over preimage, submit, schedule, and cleanup ordering
