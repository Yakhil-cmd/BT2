# Q782: pool-versus-staking split via staking bond unbond rebond on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
