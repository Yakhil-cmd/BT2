# Q2687: alias collision on execution via peoplepolkadot pallet xcm send on People Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` on People Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `LocationToAccountId` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
