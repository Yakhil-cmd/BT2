# Q4965: verify_blob_kzg_proof - evaluation shortcut soundness via Python [a-value-that-is-canonical-little-endian]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: target the fr_equal shortcut branch during verification (a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
- Invariant to test: shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge (input: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
