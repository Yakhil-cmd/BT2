# Q3870: increase_calculated_data_size panics on attacker-reachable input (account_loader.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `increase_calculated_data_size` in `svm/src/account_loader.rs` with a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `increase_calculated_data_size`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/account_loader.rs` -> `increase_calculated_data_size()` (around line 488)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide
- Exploit idea: Reach `increase_calculated_data_size` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `increase_calculated_data_size` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
