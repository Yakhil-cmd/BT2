# Q3842: remote-payout beneficiary split via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` reuses query, response, or timeout state so the same remote payout can be treated as fresh more than once, breaking the invariant that query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable, and leading to high - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions
- Exploit idea: reuses query, response, or timeout state so the same remote payout can be treated as fresh more than once
- Invariant to test: query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
