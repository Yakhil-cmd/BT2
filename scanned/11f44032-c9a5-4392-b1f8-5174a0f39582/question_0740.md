# Q740: query or topic reuse via xcmpallet teleport assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `TrustedTeleporters` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedTeleporters`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
