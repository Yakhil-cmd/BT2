# Q1148: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `min-collateral-expected` varied, and assert that the value `scale-debt-for-liquidation` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
