# Q3523: accrue-user-collateral via liquidate: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `liquidate` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, then read `accrue-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
