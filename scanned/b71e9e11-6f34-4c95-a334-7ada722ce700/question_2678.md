# Q2678: fund_xcc_sub_account() unfunded success signal from attached gas sizing for the resulting promise graph

## Question
Can an attacker make attached gas sizing for the resulting promise graph signal success for an XCC flow that is not actually funded enough to complete, so later value movement or callbacks fail and cause Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/xcc.rs::fund_xcc_sub_account -> engine/src/xcc.rs::fund_xcc_sub_account` -> `attached gas sizing for the resulting promise graph`
- Entrypoint: `fund_xcc_sub_account()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: borsh `FundXccArgs`, target EVM address, optional `wnear_account_id`, attached gas, and repeated funding timing
- Exploit idea: look for success reporting that outruns the actual funded state after the targeted step.
- Invariant to test: XCC sub-account funding must create or top up only the intended router account, with the intended wNEAR source and no stranded or duplicate value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Compare reported success with downstream NEAR-side balance and callback completion under minimum-funding cases. write integration tests that call `fund_xcc_sub_account()` with and without `wnear_account_id`, then inspect the created promises, router naming, and value routing
