# Q2366: stake-reward desync via bridgerelayers signed reward claim on Bridge reward payment logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers` signed reward-claim or beneficiary-selection path on Bridge reward payment logic and control stake-lease timing and reward-claim ordering for the same relayer account so that `BridgeRewardPayer::pay_reward` makes a reward claim succeed locally while the actual payout stays replayable, misdirected, or permanently unclaimable, breaking the invariant that stake, slash, and reward state must stay synchronized across relayer lifecycle transitions, and leading to high - payout-path corruption with concrete bridge-operational impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_common_config.rs` :: `BridgeRewardPayer::pay_reward`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers` signed reward-claim or beneficiary-selection path
- Attacker controls: stake-lease timing and reward-claim ordering for the same relayer account
- Exploit idea: makes a reward claim succeed locally while the actual payout stays replayable, misdirected, or permanently unclaimable
- Invariant to test: stake, slash, and reward state must stay synchronized across relayer lifecycle transitions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - payout-path corruption with concrete bridge-operational impact
- Fast validation: integration test over reward payout with each beneficiary type and versioned location variant
