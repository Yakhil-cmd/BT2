# Q855: proxy-batch privilege widening via xcmpallet execute send limited on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
