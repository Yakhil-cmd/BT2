# Q3651: reputation-consumption replay via runtimecall encointerceremonies signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control community ids, ceremony indices, meetup references, and participant-controlled reputation artifacts so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` makes community balances, treasuries, and reputation state disagree about which value was already spent or earned, breaking the invariant that community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows, and leading to critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path
- Attacker controls: community ids, ceremony indices, meetup references, and participant-controlled reputation artifacts
- Exploit idea: makes community balances, treasuries, and reputation state disagree about which value was already spent or earned
- Invariant to test: community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test that reorders offline-payment, reputation, and treasury actions across boundaries
