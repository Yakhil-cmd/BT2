# Q1585: destination-credit loss via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
