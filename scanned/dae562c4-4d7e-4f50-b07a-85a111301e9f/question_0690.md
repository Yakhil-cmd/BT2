# Q0690: get-available-assets via transfer: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `transfer` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `get-available-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
