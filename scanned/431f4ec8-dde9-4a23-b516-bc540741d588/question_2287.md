# Q2287: bridge-message reorder via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control swap slippage and pool-state manipulation around fee conversion into the configured Ethereum fee asset so that `CreateAssetCall / SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `CreateAssetCall / SnowbridgeFrontendLocation`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: swap slippage and pool-state manipulation around fee conversion into the configured Ethereum fee asset
- Exploit idea: causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator plus bridge-queue test proving whether reorder or replay can break one-settlement invariants
