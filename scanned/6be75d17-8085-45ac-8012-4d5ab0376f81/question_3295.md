# Q3295: revenue-claim replay via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
