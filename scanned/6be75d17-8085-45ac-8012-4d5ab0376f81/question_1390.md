# Q1390: message-export route confusion via polkadotxcm limited reserve transfer on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `Barrier` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
