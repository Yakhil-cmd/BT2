# Q0664: resolve-price-feed via supply-collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
