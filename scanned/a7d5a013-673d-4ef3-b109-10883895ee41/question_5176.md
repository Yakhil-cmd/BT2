# Q5176: principal-ratio-reduction via supply-collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
