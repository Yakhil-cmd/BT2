# Q3227: origin-conversion mismatch via coretimepolkadot pallet xcm execute on Coretime Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
