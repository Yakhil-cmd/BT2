# Q5762: calc-index-next via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) varied, and assert that the value `calc-index-next` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
