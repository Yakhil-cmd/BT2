# Q1467: touch — hash pinned sleepforever under touch file

## Question
Does touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state stay safe when an attacker gets the sync to conclude `hash == git.ref` when the ref is not actually a pinned hash (ref name equal to a hash, peeled tag) in `--touch-file` used as a readiness gate by the consumer — or can sleepForever() is entered and the sidecar never syncs again for the container's lifetime, violating “the terminal 'pinned hash' state is only reached for a genuinely pinned hash” and producing permanent denial of updates, including security updates, to the consumer?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Gets the sync to conclude `hash == git.ref` when the ref is not actually a pinned hash (ref name equal to a hash, peeled tag). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: sleepForever() is entered and the sidecar never syncs again for the container's lifetime
- Invariant to test: the terminal 'pinned hash' state is only reached for a genuinely pinned hash
- Expected Immunefi impact: permanent denial of updates, including security updates, to the consumer (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: curl the bound port from an unauthorized context and assert nothing sensitive (argv, profiles, counters) is returned
