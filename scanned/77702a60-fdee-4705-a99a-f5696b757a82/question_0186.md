# Q186: sovereign-translation mismatch via ahops unreserve lease deposit on Asset Hub operations pallet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::unreserve_lease_deposit` on Asset Hub operations pallet and control the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow so that `Pallet::transfer_to_post_migration_treasury` makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping, breaking the invariant that reserve release, contribution withdrawal, and treasury transfer must reconcile exactly with the remaining backing state, and leading to high - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/ah-ops/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::transfer_to_post_migration_treasury`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::unreserve_lease_deposit`
- Attacker controls: the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow
- Exploit idea: makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping
- Invariant to test: reserve release, contribution withdrawal, and treasury transfer must reconcile exactly with the remaining backing state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over repeated withdraw/unreserve ordering with reserve and balance assertions
