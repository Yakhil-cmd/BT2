# Q4580: resolve-price-feed via supply-collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg varied, and assert that the value `resolve-price-feed` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
