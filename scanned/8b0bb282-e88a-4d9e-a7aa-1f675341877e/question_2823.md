# Q2823: data_from_account can strand user funds permanently (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `data_from_account` in `rpc-client-nonce-utils/src/nonblocking/mod.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and drive the target account into a state that no later instruction will accept, so that the invariant "Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc-client-nonce-utils/src/nonblocking/mod.rs` -> `data_from_account()` (around line 219)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Drive an account through `data_from_account` into a state no subsequent instruction accepts, so the owner can never withdraw.
- Invariant to test: Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Exhaustive state-machine test over `data_from_account`'s transitions; assert every reachable state has a path back to a withdrawable state.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can permanently lock a victim's stake, vote, or nonce account by driving it into a state no instruction can exit, or by breaking rent-exempt or account-size invariants.
