# Q1001: resolve-ststx via liquidate-redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) — which calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down` — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the redemption receiver, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
