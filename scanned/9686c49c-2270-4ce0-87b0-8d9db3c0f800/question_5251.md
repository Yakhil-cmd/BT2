# Q5251: RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs - full-input branch copies unchecked cells via Go [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: provide all 128 cells (num_cells==CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB) so recovery copies them verbatim, then recomputes proofs from them (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
