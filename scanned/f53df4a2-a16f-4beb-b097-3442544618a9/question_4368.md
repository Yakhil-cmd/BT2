# Q4368: VerifyCellKZGProofBatch - non-canonical cell field element via Go [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyCellKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyCellKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in a cell; note the challenge hashes raw bytes before bytes_to_bls_field validates them (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
