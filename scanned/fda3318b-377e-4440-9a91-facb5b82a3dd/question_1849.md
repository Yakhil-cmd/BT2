# Q1849: calc-index-next via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `calc-index-next` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
