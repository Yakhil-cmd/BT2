# Q4842: interest-rate via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
