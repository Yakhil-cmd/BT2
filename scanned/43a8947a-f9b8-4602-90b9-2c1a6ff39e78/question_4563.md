# Q4563: next-liquidity-index via accrue: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `accrue` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
