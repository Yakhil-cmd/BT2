# Q1197: asset-converter split-brain via polkadotxcm send on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::send` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `AssetTransactors` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `AssetTransactors`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::send`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
