# Q3243: fee-asset undercharge path via coretimepolkadot pallet xcm execute on Coretime Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `Barrier` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
