# Q3627: get-available-assets via transfer: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `transfer` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-available-assets` touches, run `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
