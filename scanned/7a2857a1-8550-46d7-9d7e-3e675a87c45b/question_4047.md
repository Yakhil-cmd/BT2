# Q4047: vault-accrue via liquidate-redeem: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-accrue` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
