# Q3214: repoSync.SyncRepo — filter fallback blowup under crash resume

## Question
Does the hash resolution and change-detection logic in SyncRepo() (`rev-parse FETCH_HEAD^{}`, currentHash vs remoteHash, `reset --soft`) stay safe when an attacker pushes objects that the server cannot serve under the configured --filter (e.g. blobs the partial-clone filter cannot skip) in a resume after the previous process died between fetch and publish, leaving partial state in --root — or can the `--filter` fetch degrades to a full object transfer that the volume was never sized for, violating “partial-clone filtering bounds transferred bytes regardless of what the remote holds” and producing volume exhaustion / node disk pressure denial of service?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SyncRepo`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Pushes objects that the server cannot serve under the configured --filter (e.g. blobs the partial-clone filter cannot skip). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: the `--filter` fetch degrades to a full object transfer that the volume was never sized for
- Invariant to test: partial-clone filtering bounds transferred bytes regardless of what the remote holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: volume exhaustion / node disk pressure denial of service (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: stand up a local bare repo (file:// or `git daemon`), reproduce the ref/object shape, run git-sync for two periods and diff `readlink <link>` against the ref's real tip
