# Q2571: fee-asset undercharge path via signed user flow that on Collectives Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches collectives through valid upstream XCM` on Collectives Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin / ExecuteXcmOrigin` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches collectives through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
