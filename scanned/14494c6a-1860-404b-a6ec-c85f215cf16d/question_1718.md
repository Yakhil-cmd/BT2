# Q1718: reserve-backed asset confusion via assetconversion create pool add on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}`
- Attacker controls: liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
