# Q4370: VerifyCellKzgProofBatch - non-canonical cell field element via CSharp [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in a cell; note the challenge hashes raw bytes before bytes_to_bls_field validates them (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
