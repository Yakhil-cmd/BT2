# Q5500: repoSync.initRepo — packfile resource bomb under crash resume

## Question
Starting from a resume after the previous process died between fetch and publish, leaving partial state in --root, can an attacker who pushes a pack whose delta chains and object count explode on the client (deep delta, many tiny objects) drive the repo bootstrap in initRepo() (`git init -b git-sync`, `remote get-url/add/set-url origin`) to a state where fetch consumes CPU and memory beyond --sync-timeout, and the timeout kill leaves partial state behind, defeating “fetch cost is bounded and a timeout leaves the repo in a recoverable state” and causing sidecar resource exhaustion plus repo corruption requiring a full wipe?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.initRepo`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Pushes a pack whose delta chains and object count explode on the client (deep delta, many tiny objects). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: fetch consumes CPU and memory beyond --sync-timeout, and the timeout kill leaves partial state behind
- Invariant to test: fetch cost is bounded and a timeout leaves the repo in a recoverable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: sidecar resource exhaustion plus repo corruption requiring a full wipe (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: stand up a local bare repo (file:// or `git daemon`), reproduce the ref/object shape, run git-sync for two periods and diff `readlink <link>` against the ref's real tip
