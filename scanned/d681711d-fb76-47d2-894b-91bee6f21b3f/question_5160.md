# Q5160: interest-rate via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
