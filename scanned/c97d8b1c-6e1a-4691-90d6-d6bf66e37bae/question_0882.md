# Q882: unlock-ordering mismatch via claims claim claim attest on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
