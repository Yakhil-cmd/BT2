# Q0831: principal-ratio-reduction via accrue: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `accrue` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `principal-ratio-reduction` touches, run `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
