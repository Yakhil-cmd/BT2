# Q154: submit() delegation gap at refund and relayer reward settlement in `refund_unused_gas`

## Question
Can an attacker abuse delegated code or authorization semantics through `submit()` on the Aurora engine contract so that refund and relayer reward settlement in `refund_unused_gas` trusts the wrong code-bearing account state, enabling unauthorized value movement or Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::submit -> engine/src/engine.rs::submit_with_alt_modexp` -> `refund and relayer reward settlement in `refund_unused_gas``
- Entrypoint: `submit()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: raw signed transaction bytes, calldata, `to`/create selection, gas limits, fee caps, access lists, authorization lists, relayer account choice, and transaction replay timing
- Exploit idea: target delegated-account behavior and any code-presence assumptions at the subtarget.
- Invariant to test: every submitted transaction must be parsed once, attributed to one signer on one chain, charged once, and either commit or refund consistently
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Construct delegated and non-delegated sender states around the same logical call and assert auth, fee, and execution behavior stay consistent. write a Rust integration test that submits crafted raw transaction bytes through `submit()` and asserts sender balance, relayer reward, nonce, logs, and post-state remain consistent
