# Q0625: interpolate-rate via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) — which interpolates between packed u16 curve points — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `amount`, then read `interpolate-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
