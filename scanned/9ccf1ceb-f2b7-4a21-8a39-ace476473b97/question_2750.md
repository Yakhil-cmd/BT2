# Q2750: Cross subprotocol messages

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and inject `encode` from one subprotocol/channel into another so `encode_with_tag` confuses private vs shared or child vs parent context, leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::encode_with_tag`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `tag`, `val`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Inject child-channel or cross-channel `encode` messages where only same-channel traffic should count.
- Invariant to test: Private, shared, parent, and child channel namespaces must not overlap for `encode` messages.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `encode` data into `encode_with_tag`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
