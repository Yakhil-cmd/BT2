# Q956: Mismatch commitment and share

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and pair a valid-looking `send` with a different `private channel` reveal so `send_many` checks each piece in isolation but never the combined statement, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::send_many`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `header`, `data`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Commit to one `send` and reveal another `private channel` that still satisfies separate local checks.
- Invariant to test: A commitment and its corresponding `send` reveal must be validated as the same statement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `send` data into `send_many`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
