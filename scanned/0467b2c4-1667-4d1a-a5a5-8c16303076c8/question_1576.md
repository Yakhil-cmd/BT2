# Q1576: collateral-remove via liquidate-redeem: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
