# Q3589: community-treasury drift via runtimecall encointerceremonies signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path
- Attacker controls: offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over the exact community, ceremony, and payout sequence with balance and reputation assertions
