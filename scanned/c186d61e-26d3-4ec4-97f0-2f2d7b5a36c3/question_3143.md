# Q3143: accrue-collateral-asset via accrue: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the utilization the rate is interpolated at, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `accrue` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
