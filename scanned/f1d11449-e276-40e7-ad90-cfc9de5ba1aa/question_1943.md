# Q1943: waived-execution bypass via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `TrustedAliasers` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedAliasers`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
