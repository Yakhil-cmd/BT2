# Q3567: reputation-consumption replay via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around Encointer calls on Encointer runtime and control XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of community funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around Encointer calls
- Attacker controls: XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of community funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test that reorders offline-payment, reputation, and treasury actions across boundaries
