# Q3001: get-position via liquidate-redeem: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the borrower targeted, drive `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) — which returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `get-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
