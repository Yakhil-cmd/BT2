# Q4822: mask-shift-combine via collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-shift-combine` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422` -> `mask-shift-combine`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
