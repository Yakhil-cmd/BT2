# Q1537: DNS rebinding between check and connect - TranslateRemotes in remote.go

## Question
Does `TranslateRemotes` in [context/remote.go](context/remote.go#L105) validate a hostname and then dial it later, allowing a rebinding attacker to pass the check and serve a different address?

## Target
- File/function: [context/remote.go:105](context/remote.go#L105) - `TranslateRemotes`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated command against attacker-influenced coordinates (gh api, gh pr list, gh repo view -R ...)
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Serve a short-TTL record that flips after validation.
- Invariant to test: Validation is host-based and enforced at dial time by the same transport.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Arbitrary local file read / private data exfiltrated to an attacker-visible destination
- Fast validation: Test asserting validation happens in the transport, not only before it.
