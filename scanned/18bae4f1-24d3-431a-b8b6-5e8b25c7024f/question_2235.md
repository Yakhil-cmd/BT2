# Q2235: computeKzgProof - canonical y_out serialization via Zig [r-1-largest-canonical-scalar]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.computeKzgProof via root.zig` with r-1 (largest canonical scalar), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z) so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_kzg_proof (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.computeKzgProof via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: r-1 (largest canonical scalar). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bytes_from_bls_field emits the canonical y for boundary field values (r-1 (largest canonical scalar)).
- Invariant to test: y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: y_out bytes == the canonical big-endian encoding of p(z) (input: r-1 (largest canonical scalar)).
