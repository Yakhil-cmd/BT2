# Q772: Equivocate per recipient

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and send recipient-specific `waitpoint` variants into `reliable_broadcast_receive_all` so different honest parties bind different views of `private channel` yet still converge on an accepted downstream output, leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::reliable_broadcast_receive_all`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `participants`, `wait`, `send_vote`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Feed different `waitpoint` values to different honest parties and test whether `private channel` still converges without detection.
- Invariant to test: All honest parties must observe one consistent `waitpoint` / `private channel` transcript for the same round.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `waitpoint` data into `reliable_broadcast_receive_all`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
