# Q1552: cross-asset accounting split via assetconversion create pool add on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
