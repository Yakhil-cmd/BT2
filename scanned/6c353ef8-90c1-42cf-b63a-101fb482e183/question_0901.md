# Q901: reward-accounting drift via staking bond unbond rebond on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
