# Q1753: destination-credit loss via assets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
