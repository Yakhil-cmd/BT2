# Q1966: query or topic reuse via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
