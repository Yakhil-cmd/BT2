# Q3667: merge-price via collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the position's existing collateral and debt composition, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, then read `merge-price` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
