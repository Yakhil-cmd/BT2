# Q4861: debt-remove-scaled via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), drive `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) — which clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), then read `debt-remove-scaled` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
