# Q3042: next-liquidity-index via supply-collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `next-liquidity-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
