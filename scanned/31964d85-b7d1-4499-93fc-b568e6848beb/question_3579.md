# Q3579: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - commitment-index map collision via Python [a-duplicated-index-pair-k-k-for-the-same]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: exploit commitment_indices from deduplicate_commitments so a cell is weighted against the wrong commitment (a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one (input: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
