# Q3819: oracle-price-legal via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `oracle-price-legal` touches, run `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
