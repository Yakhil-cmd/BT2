# Q948: pool-versus-staking split via claims claim claim attest on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
