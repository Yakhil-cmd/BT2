# Q3826: remote-payout beneficiary split via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper so that `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to high - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: beneficiary conversion, fee-asset selection, and asset locations passed into the remote transfer helper
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset location, beneficiary conversion, and payment-status replay
