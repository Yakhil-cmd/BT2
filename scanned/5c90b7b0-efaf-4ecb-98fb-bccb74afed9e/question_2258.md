# Q2258: token-registration mismatch via assethubpolkadot pallet xcm send on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` on Snowbridge runtime path and control repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation so that `snowbridge_pallet_system_frontend::Config` replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match, breaking the invariant that front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_system_frontend::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation`
- Attacker controls: repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match
- Invariant to test: front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
