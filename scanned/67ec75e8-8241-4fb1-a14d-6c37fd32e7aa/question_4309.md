# Q4309: resolve via liquidate: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) — which selects the efficiency group for a position mask — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `liquidate` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, then read `resolve` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
