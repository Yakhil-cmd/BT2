# Q5529: mask-update via collateral-remove-redeem: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), drive `mask-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94) — which sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94` -> `mask-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-update` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
