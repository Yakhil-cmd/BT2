# Q1487: swap-settlement mismatch via ahops unreserve lease deposit on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
