# Q989: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - n==1 short-circuit divergence via NodeJs [a-3-item-batch-containing-two-byte-ident]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compare the n==1 path (delegates to verify_blob_kzg_proof) against the n>1 aggregation path on the same triple (a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
- Invariant to test: verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree (input: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
