# Q472: waived-execution bypass via xcmpallet limited reserve transfer on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `LocalOriginConverter` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
