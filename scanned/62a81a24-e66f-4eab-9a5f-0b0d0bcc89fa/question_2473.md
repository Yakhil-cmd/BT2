# Q2473: preimage-deposit drift via polkadotxcm execute on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control preimages, deposits, and dispatchable calls whose execution is later scheduled or referendum-driven so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}` induces a state where execution succeeds but deposit, refund, or scheduling state remains inconsistent, breaking the invariant that scheduled or post-referendum consequences must stay bound to the exact authorized preimage and deposit state, and leading to high - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: preimages, deposits, and dispatchable calls whose execution is later scheduled or referendum-driven
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but deposit, refund, or scheduling state remains inconsistent
- Invariant to test: scheduled or post-referendum consequences must stay bound to the exact authorized preimage and deposit state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over batched proxy/XCM/preimage combinations
