# Q436: message-export route confusion via xcmpallet teleport assets on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `SovereignAccountOf` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
