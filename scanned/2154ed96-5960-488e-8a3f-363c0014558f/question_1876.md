# Q1876: user-safe-mask via borrow: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `borrow` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
