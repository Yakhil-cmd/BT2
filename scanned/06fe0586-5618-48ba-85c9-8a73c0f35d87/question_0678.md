# Q0678: resolve-callcode via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `resolve-callcode` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
