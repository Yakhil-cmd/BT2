# Q3604: accrue-debt-asset via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
