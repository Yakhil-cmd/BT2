# Q5183: VerifyCellKzgProofBatch - commitment-index map collision via CSharp [cell-index-128-cells-per-ext-blob-one-pa]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: exploit commitment_indices from deduplicate_commitments so a cell is weighted against the wrong commitment (cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
- Invariant to test: cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: cell i is checked against commitment i's polynomial, never a remapped one (input: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
