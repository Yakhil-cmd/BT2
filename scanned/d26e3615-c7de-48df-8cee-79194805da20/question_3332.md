# Q3332: revenue-claim replay via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `burn_at_relay` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `burn_at_relay`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
