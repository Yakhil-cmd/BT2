# Q2954: waived-execution bypass via peoplekusama pallet xcm send on People Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeopleKusama::pallet_xcm::send` on People Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `PeopleKusama::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
