# Q1789: waived-execution bypass via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `LocationToAccountId` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
