# Q3315: CRC21 evm-chain send burn under duplicate ordering channel provenance

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through external send_to_evm_chain(address,uint,uint,uint,bytes) by controlling recipient, amount, chain_id, bridge_fee, extraData and balance when the attacker repeats or reorders value-bearing items inside one transaction or receipt, then emit cross-chain event with amount plus fee not removed from sender so that principal plus fee equals token burn or lock before bridge processing fails and IBC channel, packet, and denom trace identity cannot be attacker-selected or replayed, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/src/ModuleCRC21.sol::send_to_evm_chain
- Entrypoint: external send_to_evm_chain(address,uint,uint,uint,bytes)
- Attacker controls: recipient, amount, chain_id, bridge_fee, extraData and balance; scenario focus: duplicate ordering plus channel provenance.
- Exploit idea: emit cross-chain event with amount plus fee not removed from sender while the attacker repeats or reorders value-bearing items inside one transaction or receipt.
- Invariant to test: principal plus fee equals token burn or lock before bridge processing; also verify IBC channel, packet, and denom trace identity cannot be attacker-selected or replayed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: write a focused unit test around the named function and assert pre/post bank, module, and contract balances.
