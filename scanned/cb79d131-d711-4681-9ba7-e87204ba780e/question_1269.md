# Q1269: rpc-state via WalletCards 1269

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the daemon RPC response handling in `WalletCards` (packages/wallets/src/components/WalletCards.tsx) control subscription event for a different wallet/fingerprint after a network switch and drive the sequence load persisted state -> render approval -> execute command so the GUI would poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/wallets/src/components/WalletCards.tsx` / `WalletCards`
- Entrypoint: daemon RPC response handling
- Attacker controls: subscription event for a different wallet/fingerprint; after a network switch
- Exploit idea: poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: write a unit test around the component/hook with controlled state updates and inspect the final mutation payload
