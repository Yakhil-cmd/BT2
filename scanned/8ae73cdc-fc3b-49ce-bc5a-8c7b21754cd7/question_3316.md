# Q3316: coretime debit-allocation split via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `burn_at_relay` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `burn_at_relay`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
