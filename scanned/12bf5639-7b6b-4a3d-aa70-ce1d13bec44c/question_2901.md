# Q2901: slash-routing confusion via polkadotxcm execute send on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Kusama runtime and control asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` creates a path where identity-related state changes and asset-moving calls disagree about the effective owner or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations
- Exploit idea: creates a path where identity-related state changes and asset-moving calls disagree about the effective owner or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
