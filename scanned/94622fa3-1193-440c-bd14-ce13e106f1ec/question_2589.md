# Q2589: query or topic reuse via signed user flow that on Collectives Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches collectives through valid upstream XCM` on Collectives Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `Aliasers` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches collectives through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
