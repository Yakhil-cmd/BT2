# Q2076: queue-finalization replay via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
