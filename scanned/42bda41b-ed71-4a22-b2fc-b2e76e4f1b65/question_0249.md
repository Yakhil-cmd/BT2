# Q0249: unwrap-status via collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `unwrap-status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111) — which resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic` — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111` -> `unwrap-status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `unwrap-status` resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `unwrap-status` touches, run `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
