# Q1903: fee-asset undercharge path via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an export path that can target `XcmOverBridgeHubKusama`, `SnowbridgeExporterV2`, or legacy `SnowbridgeExporter` so that `LocationToAccountId` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: an export path that can target `XcmOverBridgeHubKusama`, `SnowbridgeExporterV2`, or legacy `SnowbridgeExporter`
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
