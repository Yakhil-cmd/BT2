# Q2502: calc-index-next via collateral-remove: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
