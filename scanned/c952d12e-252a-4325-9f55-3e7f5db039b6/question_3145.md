# Q3145: blobToKzgCommitment - Lagrange-vs-monomial commitment agreement via NodeJs [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.blobToKzgCommitment via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: poly_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.blobToKzgCommitment via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the commitment from g1_values_lagrange_brp equals the monomial-basis commitment of the same polynomial (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
