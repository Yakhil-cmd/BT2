# Q1176: query or topic reuse via polkadotxcm teleport assets on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `TrustedAliasers` makes `HollarFromHydration`, reserve matching, and asset transacting disagree about whether the transferred asset is reserve-backed or locally spendable, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedAliasers`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes `HollarFromHydration`, reserve matching, and asset transacting disagree about whether the transferred asset is reserve-backed or locally spendable
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
