# Q4246: accrue via repay: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `repay` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
