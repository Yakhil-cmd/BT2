# Q3652: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - full-input branch copies unchecked cells via Elixir [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: provide all 128 cells (num_cells==CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB) so recovery copies them verbatim, then recomputes proofs from them (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
