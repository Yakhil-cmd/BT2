# Q2138: bridge-path availability wedge via proxy proxy multisig as on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume, breaking the invariant that one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume
- Invariant to test: one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
