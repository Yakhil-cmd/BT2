# Q1468: fee-conversion inconsistency via polkadotxcm send execute transfer on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
