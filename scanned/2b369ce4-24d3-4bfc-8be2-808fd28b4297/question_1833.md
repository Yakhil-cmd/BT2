# Q1833: repoSync.SetupGitSSH — github token expiry skew under ssh known hosts

## Question
Under SSH auth with `--ssh-known-hosts` and a mounted known-hosts file, an attacker stalls syncs (slow remote) so the 30-second expiry margin in RefreshGitHubAppToken() is crossed mid-fetch. In SetupGitSSH()'s `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND` string building, SetupCookieFile(), and the redaction helpers redactURL()/logSafeFlags(), can that mean an expired or newly-minted token is stored while the old one is still in the helper cache, producing auth failure loops or a lingering valid token, so that the invariant “exactly one live token is cached and it is refreshed before use” no longer holds and the outcome is denial of updates, or a valid token cached longer than its lifetime?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupGitSSH / SetupCookieFile / redactURL / logSafeFlags`
- Entrypoint: attacker-controlled repo content or redirect target -> refreshCreds()/credential helper during the sync
- Attacker controls: Stalls syncs (slow remote) so the 30-second expiry margin in RefreshGitHubAppToken() is crossed mid-fetch. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: an expired or newly-minted token is stored while the old one is still in the helper cache, producing auth failure loops or a lingering valid token
- Invariant to test: exactly one live token is cached and it is refreshed before use
- Expected Immunefi impact: denial of updates, or a valid token cached longer than its lifetime (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: grep logs and --error-file after the failure path and assert no secret or secret-derived value appears
