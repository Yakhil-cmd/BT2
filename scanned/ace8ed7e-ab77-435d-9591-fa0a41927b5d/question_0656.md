# Q0656: Exechook.Do — hash env injection under exechook

## Question
Does Exechook.Do(): running the operator's command with cwd = the worktree path and `GITSYNC_HASH` appended to os.Environ() stay safe when an attacker makes the resolved hash string carry non-hex characters (non-commit peel result, forged worktree leaf) in a deployment using `--exechook-command` — or can `GITSYNC_HASH` carries attacker bytes into a shell-based hook's environment, violating “GITSYNC_HASH is always a validated object id” and producing command injection inside the operator's hook script?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/hook/exechook.go](pkg/hook/exechook.go) — `Exechook.Do / envKV`
- Entrypoint: attacker push -> hook fired after (or before) publish with the new hash and worktree path
- Attacker controls: Makes the resolved hash string carry non-hex characters (non-commit peel result, forged worktree leaf). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: `GITSYNC_HASH` carries attacker bytes into a shell-based hook's environment
- Invariant to test: GITSYNC_HASH is always a validated object id
- Expected Immunefi impact: command injection inside the operator's hook script (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: publish rapidly and assert the hook observed every published revision, or that skipping is explicitly reported
