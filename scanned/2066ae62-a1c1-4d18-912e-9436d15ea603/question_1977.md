# Q1977: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - weighted-proof coset power error via C [cell-index-64-first-extension-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with cell_index 64 (first extension column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each proof's weight == r^i * h_k^n for its true column so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: get_coset_shift_pow_for_cell)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 64 (first extension column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: probe get_coset_shift_pow_for_cell (cell_idx_rbl * FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_CELL) for a wrong h_k^n weight (cell_index 64 (first extension column)).
- Invariant to test: each proof's weight == r^i * h_k^n for its true column.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: each proof's weight == r^i * h_k^n for its true column (input: cell_index 64 (first extension column)).
