# Q42: submit() partial-failure replay around silo and whitelist gating in `assert_access`

## Question
Can an attacker use `submit()` on the Aurora engine contract with raw signed transaction bytes, calldata, `to`/create selection, gas limits, fee caps, access lists, authorization lists, relayer account choice, and transaction replay timing to push silo and whitelist gating in `assert_access` through a partial-failure path, then replay or retry the same user-intent so one branch keeps side effects while the retry reuses the original value or nonce budget, leading to Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::submit -> engine/src/engine.rs::submit_with_alt_modexp` -> `silo and whitelist gating in `assert_access``
- Entrypoint: `submit()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: raw signed transaction bytes, calldata, `to`/create selection, gas limits, fee caps, access lists, authorization lists, relayer account choice, and transaction replay timing
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure or retry boundary so the targeted transaction component is observed twice under inconsistent state.
- Invariant to test: every submitted transaction must be parsed once, attributed to one signer on one chain, charged once, and either commit or refund consistently
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Drive one call into a controlled revert or async failure edge, replay the same request, and assert balance, nonce, and relayer reward remain single-applied. write a Rust integration test that submits crafted raw transaction bytes through `submit()` and asserts sender balance, relayer reward, nonce, logs, and post-state remain consistent
