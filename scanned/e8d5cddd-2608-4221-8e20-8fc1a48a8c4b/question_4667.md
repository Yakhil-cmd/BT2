# Q4667: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - proof bit-reversal ordering via Rust [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof k == the reference proof for cell k so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bit_reversal_permutation)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bit_reversal_permutation on proofs matches cell ordering and the spec (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: proof k == the reference proof for cell k.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: proof k == the reference proof for cell k (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
