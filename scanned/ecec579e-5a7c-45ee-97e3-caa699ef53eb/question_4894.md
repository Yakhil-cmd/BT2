# Q4894: verifyKzgProof - chosen y paired with an infinity commitment via NodeJs [a-value-that-is-canonical-little-endian]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.verifyKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that an infinity commitment cannot verify an attacker-chosen (z,y) unless it truly commits to that poly so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: verify_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.verifyKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: set commitment to infinity and pick y so [y]G1 cancels, forging p(z)=y (a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
- Invariant to test: an infinity commitment cannot verify an attacker-chosen (z,y) unless it truly commits to that poly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: an infinity commitment cannot verify an attacker-chosen (z,y) unless it truly commits to that poly (input: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
