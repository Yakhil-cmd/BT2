# Q1363: compute_blob_kzg_proof - blob-proof determinism via Elixir [a-blob-whose-4096-field-elements-are-all]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.compute_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.compute_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm identical proof bytes across builds/precompute for a fixed blob and commitment (a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input (input: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
