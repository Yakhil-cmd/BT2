# Q958: claim-path state divergence via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
