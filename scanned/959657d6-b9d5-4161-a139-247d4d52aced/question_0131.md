# Q131: account-mapping collision via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination so that `Pallet::remote_proxy` admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable, breaking the invariant that local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination
- Exploit idea: admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable
- Invariant to test: local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
