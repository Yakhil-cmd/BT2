# Q1921: status-multi via collateral-remove: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `status-multi` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163) — which calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163` -> `status-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `status-multi` calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `status-multi` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
