# Q5125: get-cached-indexes via liquidate: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) — which reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `liquidate` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `get-cached-indexes` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
