# Q5731: subset via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) tests bitmask containment. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `subset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
