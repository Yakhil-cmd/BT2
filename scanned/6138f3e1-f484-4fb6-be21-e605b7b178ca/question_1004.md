# Q1004: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - predictable r via duplicate entries via C [a-3-item-batch-containing-two-byte-ident]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit byte-identical entries so their r-powers coincide and probe for a cancellation the transcript cannot bind (a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
- Invariant to test: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight (input: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
