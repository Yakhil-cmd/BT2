# Q1022: oracle-last-update via collateral-remove: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `oracle-last-update` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
