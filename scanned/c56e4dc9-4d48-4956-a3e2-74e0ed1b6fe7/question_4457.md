# Q4457: receive-underlying via accrue: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) — which pulls the underlying from a named account — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `accrue` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
