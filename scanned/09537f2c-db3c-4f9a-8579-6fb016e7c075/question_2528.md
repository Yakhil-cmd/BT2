# Q2528: get-full-position via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `get-full-position` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
