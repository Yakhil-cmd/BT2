# Q5998: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - weighted-proof coset power error via Python [a-non-ascending-pair-that-violates-the-s]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each proof's weight == r^i * h_k^n for its true column so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: get_coset_shift_pow_for_cell)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: probe get_coset_shift_pow_for_cell (cell_idx_rbl * FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_CELL) for a wrong h_k^n weight (a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check).
- Invariant to test: each proof's weight == r^i * h_k^n for its true column.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: each proof's weight == r^i * h_k^n for its true column (input: a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check).
