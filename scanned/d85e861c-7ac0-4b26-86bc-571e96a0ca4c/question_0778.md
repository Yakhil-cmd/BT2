# Q778: EIP-1559 parsing gas floor gap at typed envelope parsing for calldata and recipient

## Question
Can an attacker use `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-1559 transaction so that typed envelope parsing for calldata and recipient enforces too little work relative to the real execution path, enabling underpriced execution that drains relayer or protocol balances and causes Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_1559.rs` -> `typed envelope parsing for calldata and recipient`
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-1559 transaction
- Attacker controls: EIP-1559 fee fields, gas limit, access list, calldata, value, signature values, and relayer choice
- Exploit idea: undercharge work by targeting the floor or intrinsic-gas assumption baked into the subtarget.
- Invariant to test: EIP-1559 fee semantics must remain aligned between parsing, gas charging, refunding, and execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure actual work against charged gas on crafted calldata and access-list sizes, then assert no path underpays for execution. add integration tests that target EIP-1559 fee extremes and assert `charge_gas` and `refund_unused_gas` preserve the expected sender and relayer balances
