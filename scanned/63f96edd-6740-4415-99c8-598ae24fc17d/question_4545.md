# Q4545: compute_blob_kzg_proof - challenge transcript layout in compute_challenge via Elixir [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.compute_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.compute_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm compute_challenge hashes FSBLOBVERIFY_V1_ | 0 | FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB | blob | commitment in exactly the spec's byte order and widths (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
