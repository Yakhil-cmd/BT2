# Q2892: refund-beneficiary mismatch via polkadotxcm execute send on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Kusama runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
