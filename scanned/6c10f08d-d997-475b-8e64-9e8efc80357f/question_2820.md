# Q2820: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - recovered polynomial exceeds the degree bound via C [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply cells consistent on the given indices but not of degree < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB and see if recovery returns cells/proofs anyway (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
