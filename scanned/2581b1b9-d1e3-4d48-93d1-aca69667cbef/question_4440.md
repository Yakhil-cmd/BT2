# Q4440: RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs - zero divisor in coset division via CSharp [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: coset_fft)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a case where vanishing_poly_over_coset[i] is zero so fr_div hits an undefined 1/0 (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
