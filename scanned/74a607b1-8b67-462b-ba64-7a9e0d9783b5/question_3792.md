# Q3792: fee-asset settlement mismatch via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout hel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways so that `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
