# Q1506: reserve-backed asset confusion via proxy proxy multisig as on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
