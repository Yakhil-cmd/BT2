# Q1697: destination-credit loss via assetconversion create pool add on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
