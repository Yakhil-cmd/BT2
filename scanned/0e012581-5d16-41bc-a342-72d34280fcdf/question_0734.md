# Q734: blobToKzgCommitment - Lagrange-vs-monomial commitment agreement via Java [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.blobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: poly_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.blobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the commitment from g1_values_lagrange_brp equals the monomial-basis commitment of the same polynomial (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
