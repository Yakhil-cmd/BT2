# Q3824: fee-asset settlement mismatch via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout hel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer so that `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote` lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value, breaking the invariant that one treasury payout must map to one remote transfer and one final beneficiary, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer
- Exploit idea: lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value
- Invariant to test: one treasury payout must map to one remote transfer and one final beneficiary
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset location, beneficiary conversion, and payment-status replay
