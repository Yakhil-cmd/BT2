# Q0486: write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot confuses account types or owners (snapshot_utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot` in `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and have `write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` -> `write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot()` (around line 695)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `write_obsolete_accounts_to_snapshot` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
