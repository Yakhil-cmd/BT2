# Q3897: check_id behaves inconsistently at a feature/epoch boundary (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `check_id` in `precompiles/src/lib.rs` with input that makes the check pass on a value it later stops using, and have `check_id` evaluated under one rule during banking and a different one during replay, so that the invariant "A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `precompiles/src/lib.rs` -> `check_id()` (around line 34)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: input that makes the check pass on a value it later stops using
- Exploit idea: Land the transaction exactly on the slot where the gate flips so `check_id` is evaluated under one rule during scheduling and another during replay.
- Invariant to test: A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Replay the same transaction against banks on both sides of the boundary and assert both nodes agree on accept/reject and result.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
