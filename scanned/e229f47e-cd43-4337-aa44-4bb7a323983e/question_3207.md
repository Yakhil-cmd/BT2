# Q3207: calc-cumulative-debt via accrue: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) multiplies scaled principal by an index. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `accrue` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-cumulative-debt` touches, run `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
