# Q1841: receive-tokens via repay: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) — which pulls an asset from a named account — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `repay` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
