# Q695: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet execute on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::execute` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `LocalOriginConverter` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
