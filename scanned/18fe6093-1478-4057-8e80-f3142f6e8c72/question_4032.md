# Q4032: vault-accrue via accrue: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `accrue` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `vault-accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
