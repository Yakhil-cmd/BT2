# Q2641: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - r derivable before proofs are chosen via Rust [a-single-item-batch-n-1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a single-item batch (n == 1), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a single-item batch (n == 1). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check the transcript in compute_r_powers hashes commitments/z/y/proofs so r cannot be predicted then gamed (a single-item batch (n == 1)).
- Invariant to test: r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r (input: a single-item batch (n == 1)).
