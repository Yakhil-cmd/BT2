# Q5175: touch — pprof cpu dos under shared volume

## Question
Under a shared volume read by a co-tenant container, an attacker repeatedly requests `/debug/pprof/profile` and `/trace` with long durations. In touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state, can that mean profiling pins CPU and stalls the sync loop for the duration, so that the invariant “diagnostic endpoints cannot starve the sync loop” no longer holds and the outcome is denial of updates via an unauthenticated endpoint?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Repeatedly requests `/debug/pprof/profile` and `/trace` with long durations. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: profiling pins CPU and stalls the sync loop for the duration
- Invariant to test: diagnostic endpoints cannot starve the sync loop
- Expected Immunefi impact: denial of updates via an unauthenticated endpoint (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: curl the bound port from an unauthorized context and assert nothing sensitive (argv, profiles, counters) is returned
