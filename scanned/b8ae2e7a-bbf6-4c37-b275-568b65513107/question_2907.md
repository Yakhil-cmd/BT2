# Q2907: touch — errorfile tempfile flood under shared volume

## Question
Does touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state stay safe when an attacker makes errors fire on every period (any deterministic sync failure) in a shared volume read by a co-tenant container — or can `tmp-err-*` tempfiles accumulate in --root when the rename or cleanup path fails, violating “one error file exists at a time regardless of failure rate” and producing volume exhaustion via inode/file accumulation?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Makes errors fire on every period (any deterministic sync failure). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: `tmp-err-*` tempfiles accumulate in --root when the rename or cleanup path fails
- Invariant to test: one error file exists at a time regardless of failure rate
- Expected Immunefi impact: volume exhaustion via inode/file accumulation (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: break the sync deterministically and assert `/` stops returning 200 (or that the staleness is otherwise surfaced)
