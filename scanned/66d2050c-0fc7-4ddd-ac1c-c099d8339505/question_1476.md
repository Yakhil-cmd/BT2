# Q1476: ubalance via transfer: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury reach `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `transfer` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `ubalance` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
