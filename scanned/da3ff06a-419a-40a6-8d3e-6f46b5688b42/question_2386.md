# Q2386: connector ft and storage methods duplicate registration through connector target account selection in `return_promise`

## Question
Can an attacker use `ft_transfer()`, `ft_transfer_call()`, `storage_deposit()`, `storage_unregister()`, and `storage_withdraw()` on the Aurora engine contract so that connector target account selection in `return_promise` registers the same asset, account, or mapping twice under inconsistent metadata or addresses, breaking canonical mapping invariants and causing Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/connector.rs::ft_transfer / ft_transfer_call / storage_* / return_promise` -> `connector target account selection in `return_promise``
- Entrypoint: `ft_transfer()`, `ft_transfer_call()`, `storage_deposit()`, `storage_unregister()`, and `storage_withdraw()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: JSON transfer and storage arguments, attached deposit, attached 1 yocto where required, target account IDs, and repeated request ordering
- Exploit idea: create a duplicate or conflicting registration state around the targeted helper.
- Invariant to test: proxy methods into the NEAR-side connector must preserve exactly one intended account, amount, memo/message, and attached-balance meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Attempt repeated registration and mixed metadata paths, then assert the canonical mapping stays one-to-one and balances remain intact. write integration tests that inspect generated promise payloads and balances for transfer and storage calls under crafted JSON arguments and deposit values
