# Q3832: compute_kzg_proof - proof determinism across precompute/build via Elixir [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.compute_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference proof for the same (blob, z) on every build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_kzg_proof (helper: compute_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.compute_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute the proof under precompute 0 and 8 and confirm identical bytes (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference proof for the same (blob, z) on every build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference proof for the same (blob, z) on every build (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
