# Q4151: verifyBlobKzgProof - challenge transcript match via NodeJs [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the verify-side compute_challenge transcript equals the prove-side and the spec (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: verify challenge == prove challenge == reference challenge for the same blob/commitment (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
