# Q2149: remove-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) — which asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `remove-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
