# Q1641: destination-credit loss via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
