# Q503: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet send on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `LocalOriginConverter` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
