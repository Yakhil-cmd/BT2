# Q4206: accrue-user-collateral via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
