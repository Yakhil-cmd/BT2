# Q3380: CRC21 evm-chain send burn under ABI/protobuf edge supply integrity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through external send_to_evm_chain(address,uint,uint,uint,bytes) by controlling recipient, amount, chain_id, bridge_fee, extraData and balance when calldata, log data, topics, or protobuf bytes decode successfully but contain edge-case field encodings, then emit cross-chain event with amount plus fee not removed from sender so that principal plus fee equals token burn or lock before bridge processing fails and bank supply, module escrow, contract balances, and ERC totalSupply cannot diverge profitably, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/src/ModuleCRC21.sol::send_to_evm_chain
- Entrypoint: external send_to_evm_chain(address,uint,uint,uint,bytes)
- Attacker controls: recipient, amount, chain_id, bridge_fee, extraData and balance; scenario focus: ABI/protobuf edge plus supply integrity.
- Exploit idea: emit cross-chain event with amount plus fee not removed from sender while calldata, log data, topics, or protobuf bytes decode successfully but contain edge-case field encodings.
- Invariant to test: principal plus fee equals token burn or lock before bridge processing; also verify bank supply, module escrow, contract balances, and ERC totalSupply cannot diverge profitably.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: write a focused unit test around the named function and assert pre/post bank, module, and contract balances.
