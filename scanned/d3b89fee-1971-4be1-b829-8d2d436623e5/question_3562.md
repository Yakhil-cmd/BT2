# Q3562: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - deduplicate_commitments compares bytes not points via Elixir [a-compressed-point-with-the-sign-y-bit-f]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply two commitment encodings a client thinks are equal/unequal and see if deduplicate_commitments splits or merges them wrongly (a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped).
- Invariant to test: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference (input: a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped).
