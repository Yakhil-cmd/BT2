# Q1551: swap-settlement mismatch via foreignassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
