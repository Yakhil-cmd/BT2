# Q2838: iter-lookup-debt via supply-collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `iter-lookup-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
