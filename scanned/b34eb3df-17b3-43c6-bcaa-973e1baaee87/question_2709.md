# Q2709: Mix ciphersuite domains

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and exploit `echo_ready_thresholds` so `channel tag` derived for one ciphersuite, proof role, or transcript label is accepted in another domain, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::echo_ready_thresholds`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `n`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Create a domain or ciphersuite mix where `channel tag` material from one role verifies in another.
- Invariant to test: Ciphersuite-specific `channel tag` derivations must not collide across domains or protocol roles.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `channel tag` data into `echo_ready_thresholds`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
