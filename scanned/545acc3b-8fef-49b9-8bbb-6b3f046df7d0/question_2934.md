# Q2934: ComputeBlobKzgProof - challenge transcript layout in compute_challenge via CSharp [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm compute_challenge hashes FSBLOBVERIFY_V1_ | 0 | FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB | blob | commitment in exactly the spec's byte order and widths (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: the Fiat-Shamir challenge == the reference challenge for the same (blob, commitment) (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
