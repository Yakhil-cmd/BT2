# Q5128: total-assets-preview via deposit: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient`, including a contract principal reach `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `deposit` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
