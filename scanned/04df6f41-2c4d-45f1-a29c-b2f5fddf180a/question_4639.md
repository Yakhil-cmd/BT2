# Q4639: resolve-ztoken via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, then read `resolve-ztoken` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
