# Q3779: runWithStdin — webhook body oom under short backoff

## Question
Starting from the minimum 1s hook backoff, can an attacker who makes the webhook endpoint stream an endless body drive runWithStdin(): argv construction, env handling, output buffering, and cmdForLog()'s quoting for logs to a state where io.ReadAll grows without limit inside the sidecar, defeating “webhook responses are size-capped” and causing OOM kill of the sidecar: denial of updates?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/cmd.go](pkg/cmd/cmd.go) — `runWithStdin / cmdForLog`
- Entrypoint: attacker push -> hook fired after (or before) publish with the new hash and worktree path
- Attacker controls: Makes the webhook endpoint stream an endless body. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: io.ReadAll grows without limit inside the sidecar
- Invariant to test: webhook responses are size-capped
- Expected Immunefi impact: OOM kill of the sidecar: denial of updates (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: assert the hook's environment carries no credential material and its cwd is a git-sync-created worktree
