# Q937: Reuse stale public values

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and replay an old `round message` or cached `shared channel` into `recv` after the participant set or transcript changed, causing Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::recv`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `header`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Replay old public data after reshare, refresh, presign, or signer-set changes and see whether it is still consumed.
- Invariant to test: Old `round message` values must become invalid once the participant set or session context changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `round message` data into `recv`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
