# Q3604: offline-payment double-spend via runtimecall encointerbalances or encointerofflinepayment on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated, breaking the invariant that batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules, and leading to critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules
- Exploit idea: lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated
- Invariant to test: batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test that reorders offline-payment, reputation, and treasury actions across boundaries
