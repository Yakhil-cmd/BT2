# Q618: computeKzgProof - proof determinism across precompute/build via Nim [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.computeKzgProof (used by Nimbus)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference proof for the same (blob, z) on every build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_kzg_proof (helper: compute_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.computeKzgProof (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute the proof under precompute 0 and 8 and confirm identical bytes (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference proof for the same (blob, z) on every build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference proof for the same (blob, z) on every build (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
