# Q1069: calc-liq-collateral-repay via liquidate-multi: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `calc-liq-collateral-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728) — which scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)` — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728` -> `calc-liq-collateral-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), then read `calc-liq-collateral-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
