# Q2754: VerifyCellKzgProofBatch - deduplicate_commitments compares bytes not points via CSharp [the-g1-generator-point]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with the G1 generator point, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the G1 generator point. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply two commitment encodings a client thinks are equal/unequal and see if deduplicate_commitments splits or merges them wrongly (the G1 generator point).
- Invariant to test: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference (input: the G1 generator point).
