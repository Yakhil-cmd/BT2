# Q4043: verifyKzgProof - non-canonical y accepted via Nim [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.verifyKzgProof (used by Nimbus)` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that y used == canonical decode of y_bytes, else C_KZG_BADARGS and *ok stays false so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: bytes_to_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.verifyKzgProof (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply a y above the modulus and confirm bytes_to_bls_field rejects before pairing (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: y used == canonical decode of y_bytes, else C_KZG_BADARGS and *ok stays false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: y used == canonical decode of y_bytes, else C_KZG_BADARGS and *ok stays false (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
