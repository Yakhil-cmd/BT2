# Q4179: [nil / malformed signature split] `check_suite` -> CheckSuiteHandler on a bot_login configured (Shipit.user) stack

## Question
Combining the `nil / malformed signature split` verification gap (attacker sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`) with a `check_suite` event against a victim stack where bot_login configured (Shipit.user), can an unprivileged attacker make `CheckSuiteHandler` (selects stacks by `params.check_suite.head_branch` and reschedules check-run refresh for commits matching `params.check_suite.head_sha`) cause impact because auto-triggered deploys run as the configured bot identity?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/check_suite_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `check_suite` body, signature/headers; sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`; victim stack has bot_login configured (Shipit.user)
- Exploit idea: the comparison inputs are attacker-shaped and, for a no-secret org, never reached because verification short-circuits to true; `CheckSuiteHandler` selects stacks by `params.check_suite.head_branch` and reschedules check-run refresh for commits matching `params.check_suite.head_sha`; auto-triggered deploys run as the configured bot identity amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `check_suite` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of bot_login configured (Shipit.user).
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Unauthorized deploy/rollback/merge of attacker-controlled code
- Fast validation: minitest: under `nil / malformed signature split`, forge `check_suite` for a bot_login configured (Shipit.user) stack, assert the downstream effect.
