# Q5244: remove-user-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
