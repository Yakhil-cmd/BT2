# Q0844: calc-liq-factor via liquidate-multi: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `calc-liq-factor` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703` -> `calc-liq-factor`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
