# Q0080: accrue-user-debts via collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
