# Q7785: pending execution accounting mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `pending` through contract call or signed transaction reaching state transition and VM execution using raw transaction bytes, tx type fields, calldata, signature material, and pool timing and make `pending` commit balances, refunds, or receipts that disagree with the actual execution path, causing the invariant that balance deltas, refund counters, receipt fields, and state root updates must stay internally consistent to fail and leading to Balance manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: work/worker.go:222 (pending)
- Entrypoint: contract call or signed transaction reaching state transition and VM execution
- Attacker controls: raw transaction bytes, tx type fields, calldata, signature material, and pool timing
- Exploit idea: make `pending` commit balances, refunds, or receipts that disagree with the actual execution path
- Invariant to test: balance deltas, refund counters, receipt fields, and state root updates must stay internally consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances, refund counters, and receipt data across edge-case success and revert paths in one block
