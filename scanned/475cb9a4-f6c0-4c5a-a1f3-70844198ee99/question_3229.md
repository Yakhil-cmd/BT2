# Q3229: find-debt-scaled via collateral-remove: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), drive `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), then read `find-debt-scaled` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
