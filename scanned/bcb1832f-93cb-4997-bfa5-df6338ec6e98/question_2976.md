# Q2976: compute_blob_kzg_proof - emitted proof self-verifies via Python [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.compute_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.compute_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the proof compute_blob_kzg_proof returns is accepted by this library's verify_blob_kzg_proof (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
