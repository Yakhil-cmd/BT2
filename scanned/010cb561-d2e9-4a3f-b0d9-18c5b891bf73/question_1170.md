# Q1170: call() fee ceiling gap in value forwarding into `Engine::call`

## Question
Can an attacker choose gas fields through `call()` on the Aurora engine contract so that value forwarding into `Engine::call` enforces one fee ceiling while the later charging or refund path uses another, resulting in free execution or excess balance burn and thus Insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::call -> engine/src/engine.rs::call_with_args / call` -> `value forwarding into `Engine::call``
- Entrypoint: `call()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: borsh `CallArgs`, target contract address, calldata, attached value, and repeated call ordering
- Exploit idea: split fee-ceiling enforcement from actual gas payment semantics at the targeted stage.
- Invariant to test: direct EVM call entry must preserve the same balance, gas, authorization, and state-commit invariants as transaction submission
- Expected Immunefi impact: Insolvency
- Fast validation: Fuzz `max_fee_per_gas`, priority fee, gas limit, and any max-gas-price cap while checking exact sender and relayer deltas. write a Rust integration test that invokes `call()` with crafted `CallArgs`, including edge-case values and calldata, and checks status, logs, balances, and storage
