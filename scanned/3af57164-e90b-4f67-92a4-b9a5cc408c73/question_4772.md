# Q4772: compute_cells - bit-reversal ordering of cells via Python [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.compute_cells via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell k bytes == the reference cell k for the blob so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bit_reversal_permutation)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.compute_cells via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bit_reversal_permutation orders the 8192 data points into cells exactly as the spec (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: cell k bytes == the reference cell k for the blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: cell k bytes == the reference cell k for the blob (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
