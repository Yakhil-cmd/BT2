# Q0006: calc-utilization via redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` of shares burned across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-utilization` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
