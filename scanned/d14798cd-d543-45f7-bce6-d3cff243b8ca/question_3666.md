# Q3666: beneficiary resolution split via encointer pallet xcm send on Encointer XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send` on Encointer XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
