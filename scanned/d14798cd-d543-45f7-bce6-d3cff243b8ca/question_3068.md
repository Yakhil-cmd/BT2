# Q3068: username-expiry accounting drift via proxy proxy utility batch on People Kusama identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Kusama identity config and control inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched so that `IdentityInfo / fields()` creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated, breaking the invariant that encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityInfo / fields()`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched
- Exploit idea: creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated
- Invariant to test: encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
