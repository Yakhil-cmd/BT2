# Q2861: asset-fee mismatch via assets transfer transfer approved on People Polkadot asset config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}` on People Polkadot asset config and control approval-based asset movement combined with fee payment in the same call bundle so that `hollar::HollarFromHydration / HollarLocation / CreditToStakingPot` causes `HollarFromHydration`, asset conversion, and transfer logic to classify the same asset differently across the path, breaking the invariant that approval-based asset movement must not widen to a different beneficiary or fee context through batching or XCM, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misclassification of an asset balance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/assets.rs` :: `hollar::HollarFromHydration / HollarLocation / CreditToStakingPot`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: approval-based asset movement combined with fee payment in the same call bundle
- Exploit idea: causes `HollarFromHydration`, asset conversion, and transfer logic to classify the same asset differently across the path
- Invariant to test: approval-based asset movement must not widen to a different beneficiary or fee context through batching or XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misclassification of an asset balance
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test for reserve classification and settlement of the HOLLAR-like asset path
