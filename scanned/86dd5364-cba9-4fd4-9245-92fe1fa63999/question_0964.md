# Q964: pool-versus-staking split via proxy proxy multisig as on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Kusama Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
