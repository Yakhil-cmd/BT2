# Q3666: collateral-add via repay: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), can an unprivileged attacker make `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `repay` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `collateral-add` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
