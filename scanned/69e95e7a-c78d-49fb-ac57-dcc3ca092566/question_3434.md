# Q3434: asset-converter split-brain via coretimekusama pallet xcm execute on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `Barrier` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
