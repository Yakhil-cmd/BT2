# Q1531: proxy-batched asset escape via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
