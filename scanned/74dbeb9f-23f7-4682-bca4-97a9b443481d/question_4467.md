# Q4467: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - strict-ascending index check via Rust [an-ascending-list-with-one-column-index]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with an ascending list with one column index repeated later, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an ascending list with one column index repeated later. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit indices that are not strictly ascending and confirm the C_KZG_BADARGS guard fires before any write (an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
- Invariant to test: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr (input: an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
