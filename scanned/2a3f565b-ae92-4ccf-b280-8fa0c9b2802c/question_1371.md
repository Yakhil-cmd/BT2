# Q1371: computeBlobKzgProof - emitted proof self-verifies via Nim [a-blob-whose-4096-field-elements-are-all]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.computeBlobKzgProof (used by Nimbus)` with a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.computeBlobKzgProof (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the proof compute_blob_kzg_proof returns is accepted by this library's verify_blob_kzg_proof (a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
- Invariant to test: verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob (input: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
