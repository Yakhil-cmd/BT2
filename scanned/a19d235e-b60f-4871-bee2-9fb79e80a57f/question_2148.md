# Q2148: queue-finalization replay via proxy proxy multisig as on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume, breaking the invariant that signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume
- Invariant to test: signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
