# Q0050: iter-price-multi via liquidate: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `debt-amount` varied, and assert that the value `iter-price-multi` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
