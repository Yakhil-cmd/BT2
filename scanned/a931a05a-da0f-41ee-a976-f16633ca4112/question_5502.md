# Q5502: write-feed via supply-collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `write-feed` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
