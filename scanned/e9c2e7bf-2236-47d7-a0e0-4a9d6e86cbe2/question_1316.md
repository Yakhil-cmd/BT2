# Q1316: RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs - vanishing polynomial correctness via Go [cell-index-63-last-data-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with cell_index 63 (last data column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that Z(x) roots == the missing columns' evaluation points, nothing more or less so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 63 (last data column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells zeros exactly on the missing columns' cosets (cell_index 63 (last data column)).
- Invariant to test: Z(x) roots == the missing columns' evaluation points, nothing more or less.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: Z(x) roots == the missing columns' evaluation points, nothing more or less (input: cell_index 63 (last data column)).
