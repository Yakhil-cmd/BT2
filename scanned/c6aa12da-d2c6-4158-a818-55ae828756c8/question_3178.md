# Q3178: proxy-batched broker escape via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
