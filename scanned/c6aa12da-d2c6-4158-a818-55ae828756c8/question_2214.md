# Q2214: token-registration mismatch via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue_v2::Config` causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes, breaking the invariant that front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue_v2::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation
- Exploit idea: causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes
- Invariant to test: front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator plus bridge-queue test proving whether reorder or replay can break one-settlement invariants
