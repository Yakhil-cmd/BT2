# Q2166: token-registration mismatch via snowbridgesystemfrontend signed bridge path on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot on Snowbridge runtime path and control repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation so that `snowbridge_pallet_system_frontend::Config` causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes, breaking the invariant that bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model, and leading to critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_system_frontend::Config`
- Entrypoint: `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot
- Attacker controls: repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation
- Exploit idea: causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes
- Invariant to test: bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator plus bridge-queue test proving whether reorder or replay can break one-settlement invariants
