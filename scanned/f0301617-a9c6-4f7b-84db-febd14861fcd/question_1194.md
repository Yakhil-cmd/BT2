# Q1194: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - cell_index at/above the column bound via C [cell-index-63-last-data-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with cell_index 63 (last data column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that every cell_index < CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB before is_cell_used/aggregation indexes by it so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 63 (last data column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit cell_index == CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB and confirm the `>= CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB` guard fires before any indexing (cell_index 63 (last data column)).
- Invariant to test: every cell_index < CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB before is_cell_used/aggregation indexes by it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: every cell_index < CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB before is_cell_used/aggregation indexes by it (input: cell_index 63 (last data column)).
