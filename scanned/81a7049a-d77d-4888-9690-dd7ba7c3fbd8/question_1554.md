# Q1554: calc-treasury-lp-preview via liquidate-redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault whose share price the redemption moves across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-treasury-lp-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
