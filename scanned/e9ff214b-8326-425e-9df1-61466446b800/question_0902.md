# Q902: claim-path state divergence via nominationpools join bond extra on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
