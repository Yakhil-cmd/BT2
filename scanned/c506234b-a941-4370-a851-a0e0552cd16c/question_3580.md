# Q3580: calc-liq-factor-exp via liquidate-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault whose share price the redemption moves reach `calc-liq-factor-exp` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708` -> `calc-liq-factor-exp`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-exp` uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
