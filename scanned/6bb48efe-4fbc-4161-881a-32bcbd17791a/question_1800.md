# Q1800: vault-system-borrow via repay: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `vault-system-borrow` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
