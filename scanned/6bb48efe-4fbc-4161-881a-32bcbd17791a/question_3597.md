# Q3597: resolve-interpolation-points via supply-collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, drive `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) — which selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-interpolation-points` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
