# Q3606: resolve-pyth via liquidate-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-pyth` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
