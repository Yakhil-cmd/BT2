# Q715: BlobToKzgCommitment - commitment determinism vs the bit-reversed Lagrange setup via CSharp [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.BlobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitment bytes == the reference spec commitment for the same blob on every build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: poly_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.BlobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check blob_to_kzg_commitment maps blob positions to g1_values_lagrange_brp identically on every node/precompute (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: commitment bytes == the reference spec commitment for the same blob on every build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: commitment bytes == the reference spec commitment for the same blob on every build (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
