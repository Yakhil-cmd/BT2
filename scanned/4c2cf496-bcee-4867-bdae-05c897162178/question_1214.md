# Q1214: resolve-ststx via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `resolve-ststx` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
