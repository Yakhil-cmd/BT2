# Q0242: get-asset-value via supply-collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) varied, and assert that the value `get-asset-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
