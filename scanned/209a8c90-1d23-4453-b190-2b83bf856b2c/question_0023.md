# Q23: account-mapping collision via multisig as multi remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary so that `Pallet::do_remote_proxy` resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch, breaking the invariant that a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::do_remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof
- Attacker controls: a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary
- Exploit idea: resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch
- Invariant to test: a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
