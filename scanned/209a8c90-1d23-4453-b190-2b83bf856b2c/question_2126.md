# Q2126: bridge-path availability wedge via proxy proxy multisig as on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` causes inbound, outbound, relayer-reward, and XCM routing state to disagree about which message or beneficiary was finalized, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: causes inbound, outbound, relayer-reward, and XCM routing state to disagree about which message or beneficiary was finalized
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
