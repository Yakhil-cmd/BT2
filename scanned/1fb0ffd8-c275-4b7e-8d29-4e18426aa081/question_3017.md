# Q3017: accrue-user-debts via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) — which folds accrual over the position's debt list only — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
