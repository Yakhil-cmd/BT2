# Q1003: accrue-user-collateral via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `accrue-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
