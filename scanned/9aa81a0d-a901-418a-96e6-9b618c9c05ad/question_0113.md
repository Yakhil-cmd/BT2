# Q113: VerifyBlobKZGProof - in-domain challenge shortcut in verification via Go [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose challenge is a domain root so evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form takes the shortcut, and probe for a y mismatch (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
