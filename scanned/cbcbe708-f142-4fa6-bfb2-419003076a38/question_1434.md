# Q1434: fee-asset undercharge path via polkadotxcm transfer assets on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `FeeManager` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
