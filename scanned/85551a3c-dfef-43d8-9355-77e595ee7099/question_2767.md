# Q2767: username-expiry accounting drift via identity set identity clear on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Polkadot identity config and control inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched so that `impl pallet_identity::Config` makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination, breaking the invariant that identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `impl pallet_identity::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched
- Exploit idea: makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination
- Invariant to test: identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
