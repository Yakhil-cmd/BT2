# Q0090: calc-liq-collateral-repay via liquidate-multi: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-collateral-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728` -> `calc-liq-collateral-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-collateral-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
