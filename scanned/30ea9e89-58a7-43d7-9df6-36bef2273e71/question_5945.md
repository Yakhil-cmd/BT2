# Q5945: system-borrow via liquidate-multi: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, drive `system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865) — which independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865` -> `system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `system-borrow` independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
