# Q5561: iter-lookup-collateral via supply-collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) — which skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
