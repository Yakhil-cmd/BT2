# Q2192: calc-liq-collateral-repay via liquidate-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `calc-liq-collateral-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728` -> `calc-liq-collateral-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `calc-liq-collateral-repay` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
