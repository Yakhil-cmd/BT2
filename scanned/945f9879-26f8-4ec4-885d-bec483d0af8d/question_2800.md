# Q2800: sub-account deposit leak via proxy proxy utility batch on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Polkadot identity config and control identity metadata, username state, and sub-account deposit sizing around repeated set and clear operations so that `IdentityInfo / fields()` causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable, breaking the invariant that identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once, and leading to high - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityInfo / fields()`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: identity metadata, username state, and sub-account deposit sizing around repeated set and clear operations
- Exploit idea: causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable
- Invariant to test: identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing
- Fast validation: targeted test proving whether treasury routing resolves to the expected account after adversarial input
