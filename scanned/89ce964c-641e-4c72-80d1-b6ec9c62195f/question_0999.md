# Q999: cross-pallet hold mismatch via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering
- Exploit idea: forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
