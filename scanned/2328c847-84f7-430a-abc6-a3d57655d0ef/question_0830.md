# Q830: pool-versus-staking split via xcmpallet execute send limited on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
