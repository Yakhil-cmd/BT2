# Q3617: community-treasury drift via runtimecall encointerbalances or encointerofflinepayment on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state, breaking the invariant that each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of community funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path
- Attacker controls: XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state
- Invariant to test: each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of community funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test that reorders offline-payment, reputation, and treasury actions across boundaries
