# Q1483: proxy-batched asset escape via staking signed user path on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::* signed user path` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::* signed user path`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
