# Q2812: sub-account deposit leak via identity set identity clear on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Polkadot identity config and control locations or treasury-routing state that receive slashed identity deposits so that `IdentityInfo / fields()` causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable, breaking the invariant that treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityInfo / fields()`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: locations or treasury-routing state that receive slashed identity deposits
- Exploit idea: causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable
- Invariant to test: treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle
- Fast validation: targeted test proving whether treasury routing resolves to the expected account after adversarial input
