# Q5201: next-liquidity-index via collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) — which rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
