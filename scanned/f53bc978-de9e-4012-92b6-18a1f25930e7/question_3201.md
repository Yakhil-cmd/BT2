# Q3201: message-export route confusion via coretimepolkadot pallet xcm execute on Coretime Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
