# Q1953: asset-converter split-brain via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / WaivedLocations` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / WaivedLocations`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
