# Q0570: get-full-position via borrow: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `borrow` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `get-full-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
