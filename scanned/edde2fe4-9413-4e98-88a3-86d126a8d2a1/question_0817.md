# Q817: EIP-4844 parsing log filter mismatch after typed envelope decoding in the 4844 parser

## Question
Can an attacker make typed envelope decoding in the 4844 parser emit logs or promise markers that the engine filters differently from the committed state, letting external systems or callbacks act on the wrong interpretation and eventually causing Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_4844.rs` -> `typed envelope decoding in the 4844 parser`
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-4844 transaction path
- Attacker controls: typed transaction bytes, blob-related fee fields, calldata, recipient/create choice, signature values, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: exploit disagreement between emitted logs/promise markers and committed value movement around the subtarget.
- Invariant to test: EIP-4844 parsing must not let blob-style fee or envelope fields desynchronize gas accounting from execution intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Capture raw logs and filtered logs for crafted transactions and confirm they cannot imply value movement different from committed state. add parser tests plus local execution tests that mutate typed-envelope and fee fields and check sender, fee charge, refund, and resulting state
