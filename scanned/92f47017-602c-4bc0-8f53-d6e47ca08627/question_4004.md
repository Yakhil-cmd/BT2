# Q4004: receive-tokens via transfer: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation varied, and assert that the value `receive-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
