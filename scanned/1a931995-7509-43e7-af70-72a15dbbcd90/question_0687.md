# Q687: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - identity encoding of a cell proof via Python [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_g1)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check a proof that is the identity is compressed exactly as the spec (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
