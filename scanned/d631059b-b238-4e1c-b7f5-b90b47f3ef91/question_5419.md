# Q5419: mask-to-list-iter via collateral-remove-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), then read `mask-to-list-iter` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
