# Q4212: [organization fallback selection] `pull_request` action=`labeled` -> LabeledHandler on a review_stacks_enabled false stack

## Question
Combining the `organization fallback selection` verification gap (attacker omits `repository` so `repository_owner` falls back to `organization.login`, choosing a lenient verifier while the handler reads the repo from another field) with a `pull_request` action=`labeled` event against a victim stack where review_stacks_enabled false, can an unprivileged attacker make `LabeledHandler` (archives or unarchives the review stack based on the provisioning label) cause impact because review stacks are supposedly disabled yet the provision? precedence bug still provisions?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/pull_request/labeled_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `pull_request` body action=`labeled`, signature/headers; omits `repository` so `repository_owner` falls back to `organization.login`, choosing a lenient verifier while the handler reads the repo from another field; victim stack has review_stacks_enabled false
- Exploit idea: `repository_owner` (verifier selector) and the handler's `repository.full_name` come from different, independently attacker-set fields; `LabeledHandler` archives or unarchives the review stack based on the provisioning label; review stacks are supposedly disabled yet the provision? precedence bug still provisions amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `pull_request` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of review_stacks_enabled false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Remote Code Execution on the Shipit deploy host (HackerOne/Immunefi RCE class)
- Fast validation: minitest: under `organization fallback selection`, forge `pull_request` action=`labeled` for a review_stacks_enabled false stack, assert the downstream effect.
