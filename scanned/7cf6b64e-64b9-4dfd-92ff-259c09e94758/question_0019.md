# Q0019: mask-pos via collateral-remove: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), then read `mask-pos` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
