# Q1858: security decision from response field - NewLiveClient in client.go

## Question
Does `NewLiveClient` in [pkg/cmd/attestation/api/client.go](pkg/cmd/attestation/api/client.go#L78) branch on a boolean/permission/visibility field of the response that the attacker owns (their repo, their codespace, their gist) to decide what to write, execute, or trust locally?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/attestation/api/client.go:78](pkg/cmd/attestation/api/client.go#L78) - `NewLiveClient`
- Entrypoint: gh attestation
- Attacker controls: an artifact, its Sigstore bundle, and the attacker's own repo/workflow claims
- Exploit idea: Publish an object with the field flipped and observe the local behaviour change.
- Invariant to test: Local trust decisions never depend on attacker-owned object fields.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Authentication/authorization bypass in gh: wrong account or host credentials used for a privileged action
- Fast validation: Test flipping the field asserting no change to the local security-relevant action.
