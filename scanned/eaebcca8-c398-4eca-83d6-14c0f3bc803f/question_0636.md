# Q636: message-export route confusion via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `Barrier` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
