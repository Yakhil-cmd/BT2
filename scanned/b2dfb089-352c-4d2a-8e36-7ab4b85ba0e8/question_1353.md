# Q1353: get_obsolete_bytes can be driven into unbounded work (account_storage_entry.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `get_obsolete_bytes` in `accounts-db/src/account_storage_entry.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make `get_obsolete_bytes` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `get_obsolete_bytes` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/account_storage_entry.rs` -> `get_obsolete_bytes()` (around line 149)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `get_obsolete_bytes` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `get_obsolete_bytes` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `get_obsolete_bytes` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
