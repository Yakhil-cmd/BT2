# Q5360: receive-underlying via deposit: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it pulls the underlying from a named account, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `deposit` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge varied, and assert that the value `receive-underlying` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
