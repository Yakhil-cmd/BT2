# Q908: pool-versus-staking split via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
