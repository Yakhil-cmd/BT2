# Q159: account-mapping collision via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::remote_proxy` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary so that `Pallet::remote_proxy` admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::remote_proxy`
- Attacker controls: a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary
- Exploit idea: admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: nested batch and multisig test asserting exactly which proof is popped and which call consumes it
