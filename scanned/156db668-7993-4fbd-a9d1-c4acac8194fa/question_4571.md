# Q4571: computeBlobKzgProof - blob-proof determinism via NodeJs [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.computeBlobKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.computeBlobKzgProof via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm identical proof bytes across builds/precompute for a fixed blob and commitment (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
