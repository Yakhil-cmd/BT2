# Q5326: filter-u128 via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
