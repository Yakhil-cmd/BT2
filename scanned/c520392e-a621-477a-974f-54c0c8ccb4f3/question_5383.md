# Q5383: ComputeBlobKzgProof - emitted proof self-verifies via CSharp [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the proof compute_blob_kzg_proof returns is accepted by this library's verify_blob_kzg_proof (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: verify_blob_kzg_proof(compute_blob_kzg_proof(blob), ...) == true for every blob (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
