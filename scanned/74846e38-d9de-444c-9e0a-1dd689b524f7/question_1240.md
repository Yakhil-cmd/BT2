# Q1240: interpolate-rate via accrue: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `accrue` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
