# Q2262: refresh via repay: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, can an unprivileged attacker make `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `repay` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `refresh` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
