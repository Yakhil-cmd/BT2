# Q1487: terminal command injection via escape - setupGitRun in setupgit.go

## Question
Can attacker-supplied text rendered by `setupGitRun` in [pkg/cmd/auth/setupgit/setupgit.go](pkg/cmd/auth/setupgit/setupgit.go#L75) carry sequences that terminals execute or auto-report (OSC 8 with a non-http URI, bracketed-paste break, title-set-then-report), turning display into command execution?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/auth/setupgit/setupgit.go:75](pkg/cmd/auth/setupgit/setupgit.go#L75) - `setupGitRun`
- Entrypoint: gh auth setupgit
- Attacker controls: a hostname, OAuth/device response, or git credential-protocol input the attacker supplies
- Exploit idea: Embed the payload in a PR title/body/check output the victim displays.
- Invariant to test: Only a safe subset of styling is emitted; hyperlinks are restricted to http(s).
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Remote code execution on the victim's developer machine (GitHub Bug Bounty: RCE in gh; Immunefi 'Websites and Apps' class: arbitrary code execution)
- Fast validation: Test asserting rendered hyperlinks/URIs are scheme-checked and controls stripped.
