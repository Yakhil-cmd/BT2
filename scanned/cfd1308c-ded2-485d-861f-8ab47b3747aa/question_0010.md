# Q10: proxy-type widening via register remote proxy proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `register_remote_proxy_proof + remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` in one transaction on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination so that `BlockToRoot / RemoteProxyContext` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close, and leading to critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `BlockToRoot / RemoteProxyContext`
- Entrypoint: `register_remote_proxy_proof + remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` in one transaction
- Attacker controls: a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
