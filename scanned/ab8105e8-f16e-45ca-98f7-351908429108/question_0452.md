# Q452: waived-execution bypass via xcmpallet teleport assets on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `Barrier` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
