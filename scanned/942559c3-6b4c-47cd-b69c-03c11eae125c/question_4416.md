# Q4416: zip via redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
