# Q4884: calc-utilization via accrue: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `accrue` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `calc-utilization` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
