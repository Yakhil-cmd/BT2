# Q5007: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - n==1 short-circuit divergence via Zig [a-128-cell-batch-all-mapped-to-one-colum]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compare the n==1 path (delegates to verify_blob_kzg_proof) against the n>1 aggregation path on the same triple (a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column).
- Invariant to test: verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree (input: a 128-cell batch all mapped to one column).
