# Q5595: resolve-callcode via liquidate: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-callcode` touches, run `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
