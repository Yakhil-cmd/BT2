# Q2064: remove-user-collateral via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
