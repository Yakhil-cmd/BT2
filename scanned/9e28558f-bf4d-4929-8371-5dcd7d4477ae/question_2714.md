# Q2714: VerifyCellKzgProofBatch - num_cells not upper-bounded via CSharp [a-single-item-batch-n-1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a single-item batch (n == 1), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyCellKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a single-item batch (n == 1). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass a num_cells far above CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB and drive the input_size / calloc arithmetic in the challenge toward overflow (a single-item batch (n == 1)).
- Invariant to test: allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: allocation size == exact transcript length; num_cells has a spec bound and no multiply wraps (input: a single-item batch (n == 1)).
