# Q4218: VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch - predictable r via duplicate entries via Go [a-batch-whose-proofs-are-permuted-relati]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit byte-identical entries so their r-powers coincide and probe for a cancellation the transcript cannot bind (a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
- Invariant to test: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight (input: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
