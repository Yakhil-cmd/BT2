# Q2510: preimage-deposit drift via preimage note preimage unnote on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Preimage::{note_preimage, unnote_preimage}` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control user-controlled inputs that feed plurality-like execution or post-deposit cleanup logic so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}` makes open user submission paths disagree with later dispatch, deposit, or cleanup logic about what was authorized, breaking the invariant that preimage and referendum-related deposits must be debited, refunded, and consumed exactly once, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged execution with direct user or treasury loss?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Alliance, FellowshipReferenda, AmbassadorReferenda, Preimage, Scheduler, Proxy, Utility, PolkadotXcm}`
- Entrypoint: `Preimage::{note_preimage, unnote_preimage}`
- Attacker controls: user-controlled inputs that feed plurality-like execution or post-deposit cleanup logic
- Exploit idea: makes open user submission paths disagree with later dispatch, deposit, or cleanup logic about what was authorized
- Invariant to test: preimage and referendum-related deposits must be debited, refunded, and consumed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged execution with direct user or treasury loss
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over preimage, submit, schedule, and cleanup ordering
