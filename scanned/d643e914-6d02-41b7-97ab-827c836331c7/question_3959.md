# Q3959: blocked address value movement under replay attempt cross-phase equality

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation by controlling tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix when the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback, then bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction so that blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings fails and CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: app/proposal.go::ValidateTransaction
- Entrypoint: PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation
- Attacker controls: tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix; scenario focus: replay attempt plus cross-phase equality.
- Exploit idea: bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction while the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback.
- Invariant to test: blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings; also verify CheckTx, proposal verification, execution, export/import, and replay see the same message and state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: use a malicious minimal EVM contract or marshaled protobuf payload to exercise the entrypoint and inspect all state diffs.
