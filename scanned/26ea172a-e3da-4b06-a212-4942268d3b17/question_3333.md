# Q3333: coretime debit-allocation split via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
