# Q3273: proxy-batched broker escape via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic on Coretime allocator logic and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path that triggers allocator, burn, or revenue logic
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
