# Q423: RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs - zero divisor in coset division via Go [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: coset_fft)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a case where vanishing_poly_over_coset[i] is zero so fr_div hits an undefined 1/0 (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
