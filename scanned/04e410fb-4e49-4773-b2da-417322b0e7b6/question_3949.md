# Q3949: blob_to_kzg_commitment - Lagrange-vs-monomial commitment agreement via Python [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.blob_to_kzg_commitment via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: poly_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.blob_to_kzg_commitment via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the commitment from g1_values_lagrange_brp equals the monomial-basis commitment of the same polynomial (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: commitment == the unique KZG commitment of the blob polynomial regardless of basis (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
