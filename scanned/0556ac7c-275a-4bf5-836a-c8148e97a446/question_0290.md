# Q0290: native-to-CRC21 auto deploy under remap window supply integrity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through MsgConvertVouchers for non-IbcCroDenom native assets by controlling sender, denom, amount, auto-deploy state and mapping state when token mappings, params, permissions, or packet state change between check, execution, callback, or acknowledgement, then register or use the wrong auto-deployed CRC21 contract for a valuable denom so that one denom has one canonical backed contract and no duplicate redeemable supply fails and bank supply, module escrow, contract balances, and ERC totalSupply cannot diverge profitably, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: x/cronos/keeper/evm.go::ConvertCoinFromNativeToCRC21
- Entrypoint: MsgConvertVouchers for non-IbcCroDenom native assets
- Attacker controls: sender, denom, amount, auto-deploy state and mapping state; scenario focus: remap window plus supply integrity.
- Exploit idea: register or use the wrong auto-deployed CRC21 contract for a valuable denom while token mappings, params, permissions, or packet state change between check, execution, callback, or acknowledgement.
- Invariant to test: one denom has one canonical backed contract and no duplicate redeemable supply; also verify bank supply, module escrow, contract balances, and ERC totalSupply cannot diverge profitably.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: write a focused unit test around the named function and assert pre/post bank, module, and contract balances. Scoped to live HackenProof Cronos Blockchain Protocols: cryptographic flaws and vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds; excludes DoS/DDoS/spam, gas draining, leaked keys, privileged-address/admin abuse, basic governance attacks, known fork/dependency issues without a working Cronos PoC, tests, mocks, scripts, docs, disabled configs, and non-production code.
