# Q4027: uint-to-list-u64 via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, then read `uint-to-list-u64` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
