# Q1742: subset via collateral-remove: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `subset` tests bitmask containment, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `subset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
