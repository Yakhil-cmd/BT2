# Q2282: computeCellsAndKzgProofs - emitted cell proofs self-verify via NodeJs [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.computeCellsAndKzgProofs via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.computeCellsAndKzgProofs via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch accepts the (commitment,index,cell,proof) tuples this function emits (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
