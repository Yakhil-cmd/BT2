# Q4749: write-feed via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) — which applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `write-feed` touches, run `borrow` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
