# Q2245: get-bitmap via collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) — which returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, then read `get-bitmap` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
