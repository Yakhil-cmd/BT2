# Q418: query or topic reuse via xcmpallet send on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `Barrier` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
