# Q3832: fee-asset settlement mismatch via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` reuses query, response, or timeout state so the same remote payout can be treated as fresh more than once, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways
- Exploit idea: reuses query, response, or timeout state so the same remote payout can be treated as fresh more than once
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
