# Q1877: waived-execution bypass via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an export path that can target `XcmOverBridgeHubKusama`, `SnowbridgeExporterV2`, or legacy `SnowbridgeExporter` so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an export path that can target `XcmOverBridgeHubKusama`, `SnowbridgeExporterV2`, or legacy `SnowbridgeExporter`
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
