# Q1255: increment via collateral-remove-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) advances the user-id nonce. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, then read `increment` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
