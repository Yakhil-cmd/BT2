# Q1469: get-position via liquidate-multi: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) — which returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
