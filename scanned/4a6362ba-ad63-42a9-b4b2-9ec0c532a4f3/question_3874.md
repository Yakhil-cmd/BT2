# Q3874: repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs — submodule symlink escape under shared volume

## Question
Under a shared volume where the published tree is read by another container, an attacker combines a symlink in the superproject with a submodule path that traverses it. In the global git config git-sync installs before any submodule work (credential.helper cache, core.askPass true), can that mean submodule content is written outside the worktree through the symlink, so that the invariant “submodule writes resolve inside the worktree after symlink resolution” no longer holds and the outcome is arbitrary file write outside --root?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs`
- Entrypoint: attacker-committed `.gitmodules` -> `submodule update --init` inside configureWorktree()
- Attacker controls: Combines a symlink in the superproject with a submodule path that traverses it. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: submodule content is written outside the worktree through the symlink
- Invariant to test: submodule writes resolve inside the worktree after symlink resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: arbitrary file write outside --root (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: host the fixture superproject and submodule locally and assert `submodule update` spawns no process other than git and contacts no host but the configured remote
