# Q1017: crowdloan exit inconsistency via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
