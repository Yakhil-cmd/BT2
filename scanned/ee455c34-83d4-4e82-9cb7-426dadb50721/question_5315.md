# Q5315: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - recovered proofs match recovered cells via Python [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch over recovered cells/proofs == true so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the recomputed proofs verify against the recovered cells and original commitment (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch over recovered cells/proofs == true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch over recovered cells/proofs == true (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
