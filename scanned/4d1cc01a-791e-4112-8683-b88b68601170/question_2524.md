# Q2524: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via collectivespolkadot pallet xcm execute on Collectives Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
