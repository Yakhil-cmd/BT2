# Q4924: [legacy sha1 signature header] `pull_request` action=`unlabeled` -> LabelCapturingHandler on a org configured without webhook_secret stack

## Question
Combining the `legacy sha1 signature header` verification gap (attacker supplies `X-Hub-Signature: sha1=...` (the only algorithm `verify_webhook_signature` accepts) rather than the modern `X-Hub-Signature-256`) with a `pull_request` action=`unlabeled` event against a victim stack where org configured without webhook_secret, can an unprivileged attacker make `LabelCapturingHandler` (persists `params.pull_request.labels.map(&:name)` onto the review stack's `PullRequest`, and those names become uppercased environment keys in `ReviewStack#env`) cause impact because forged webhooks for this org are accepted unconditionally?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/pull_request/label_capturing_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `pull_request` body action=`unlabeled`, signature/headers; supplies `X-Hub-Signature: sha1=...` (the only algorithm `verify_webhook_signature` accepts) rather than the modern `X-Hub-Signature-256`; victim stack has org configured without webhook_secret
- Exploit idea: the code path that could reject a forged body depends on an algorithm/secret combination the attacker can sidestep for a no-secret org; `LabelCapturingHandler` persists `params.pull_request.labels.map(&:name)` onto the review stack's `PullRequest`, and those names become uppercased environment keys in `ReviewStack#env`; forged webhooks for this org are accepted unconditionally amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `pull_request` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of org configured without webhook_secret.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Authentication/authorization bypass (forged webhook or session accepted as trusted)
- Fast validation: minitest: under `legacy sha1 signature header`, forge `pull_request` action=`unlabeled` for a org configured without webhook_secret stack, assert the downstream effect.
