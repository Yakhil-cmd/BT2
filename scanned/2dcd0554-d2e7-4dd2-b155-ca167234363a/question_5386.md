# Q5386: mask-to-list-internal via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
