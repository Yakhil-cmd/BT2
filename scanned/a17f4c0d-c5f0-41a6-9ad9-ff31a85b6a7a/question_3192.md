# Q3192: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `vault-socialize-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
