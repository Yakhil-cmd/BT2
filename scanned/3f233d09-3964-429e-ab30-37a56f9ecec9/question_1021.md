# Q1021: reward-accounting drift via claims claim claim attest on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering
- Exploit idea: makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
