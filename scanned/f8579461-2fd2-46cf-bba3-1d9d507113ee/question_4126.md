# Q4126: verify_blob_kzg_proof - in-domain challenge shortcut in verification via C [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose challenge is a domain root so evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form takes the shortcut, and probe for a y mismatch (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
