# Q4337: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - coset-shift index collision via Rust [an-ascending-list-with-one-column-index]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with an ascending list with one column index repeated later, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: get_inv_coset_shift_for_cell)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an ascending list with one column index repeated later. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: find two cell indices whose reverse_bits_limited coset factor maps to the same roots_of_unity shift (an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
- Invariant to test: each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift (input: an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
