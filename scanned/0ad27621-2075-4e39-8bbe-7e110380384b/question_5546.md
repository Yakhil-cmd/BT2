# Q5546: mask-to-list-collateral via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `mask-to-list-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
