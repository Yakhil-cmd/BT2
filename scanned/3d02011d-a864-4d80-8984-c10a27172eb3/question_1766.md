# Q1766: verify_blob_kzg_proof - non-canonical blob element in verify via Elixir [r-1-largest-canonical-scalar]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with r-1 (largest canonical scalar), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: blob_to_polynomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: r-1 (largest canonical scalar). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in the blob and confirm blob_to_polynomial rejects before pairing (r-1 (largest canonical scalar)).
- Invariant to test: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false (input: r-1 (largest canonical scalar)).
