# Q2524: accrue-debt-asset via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
