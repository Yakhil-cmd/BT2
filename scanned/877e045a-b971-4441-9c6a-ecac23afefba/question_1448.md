# Q1448: ComputeCellsAndKzgProofs - FK20 stride/Toeplitz mapping via CSharp [a-blob-whose-4096-field-elements-are-all]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each cell proof == the reference FK20 proof for that column so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify circulant_coeffs_stride and x_ext_fft_columns produce spec-correct multi-proofs (a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
- Invariant to test: each cell proof == the reference FK20 proof for that column.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: each cell proof == the reference FK20 proof for that column (input: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
