# Q5831: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - predictable r via duplicate entries via Elixir [a-batch-mixing-a-valid-entry-with-one-wh]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit byte-identical entries so their r-powers coincide and probe for a cancellation the transcript cannot bind (a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity).
- Invariant to test: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight (input: a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity).
