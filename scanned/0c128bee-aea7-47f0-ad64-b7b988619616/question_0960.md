# Q960: unlock-ordering mismatch via proxy proxy multisig as on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Kusama Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
