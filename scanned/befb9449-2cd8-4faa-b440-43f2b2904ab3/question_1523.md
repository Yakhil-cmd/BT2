# Q1523: proxy-batched asset escape via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
