# Q5138: identity matched by substring - (Client).ShowRefs in client.go

## Question
Does the certificate identity check in `ShowRefs` in [git/client.go](git/client.go#L243) use prefix/substring/regex matching so `github.com/victim-org/repo-evil` or an attacker fork satisfies a policy meant for `victim-org/repo`?

## Target
- File/function: [git/client.go:243](git/client.go#L243) - `(Client).ShowRefs`
- Entrypoint: gh repo clone
- Attacker controls: a repository, branch, tag, PR head ref, remote, or .gitmodules entry the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Build a real signed artifact from an attacker repository whose URL contains the expected string.
- Invariant to test: SAN, issuer, and source-repository claims are compared with exact, anchored equality.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Supply-chain verification bypass: unsigned or wrongly attributed artifact reported as verified
- Fast validation: Table test over near-miss identity URIs asserting each is rejected.
