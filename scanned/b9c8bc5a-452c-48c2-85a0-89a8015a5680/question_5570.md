# Q5570: compute_cells - bit-reversal ordering of cells via Rust [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell k bytes == the reference cell k for the blob so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bit_reversal_permutation)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bit_reversal_permutation orders the 8192 data points into cells exactly as the spec (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: cell k bytes == the reference cell k for the blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: cell k bytes == the reference cell k for the blob (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
