# Q1398: calc-multiplier-delta via liquidate-multi: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-multiplier-delta` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
