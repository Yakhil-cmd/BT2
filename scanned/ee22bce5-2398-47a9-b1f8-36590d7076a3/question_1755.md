# Q1755: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate-multi: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `scale-debt-for-liquidation` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
