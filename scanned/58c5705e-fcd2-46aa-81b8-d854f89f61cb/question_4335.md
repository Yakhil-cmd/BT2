# Q4335: Forged `status` webhook via nil / malformed signature split reaches StatusHandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged internet user POST a `status` event to `/webhooks` that sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`, so `WebhooksController#verify_signature` accepts it and `Shipit::Webhooks::Handlers::StatusHandler` runs `Commit.where(sha: params.sha).each { |c| c.create_status_from_github!(params) }` with no repository scoping at all, even though the attacker holds no `webhook_secret`?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/status_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the full JSON body, `X-Github-Event: status` header, and `X-Hub-Signature`; specifically it sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`
- Exploit idea: the comparison inputs are attacker-shaped and, for a no-secret org, never reached because verification short-circuits to true; the accepted body then drives `Shipit::Webhooks::Handlers::StatusHandler` which runs `Commit.where(sha: params.sha).each { |c| c.create_status_from_github!(params) }` with no repository scoping at all
- Invariant to test: The organization whose webhook_secret verified the request equals the organization that owns the repository/stack/commit/team the handler writes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Cross-tenant/cross-repository state manipulation (one repo's payload writes another repo's records)
- Fast validation: minitest ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest: configure one org with no webhook_secret, POST the crafted `status` body, assert the handler ran and mutated a record owned by a different org.
