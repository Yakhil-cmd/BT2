# Q3546: cross-ceremony state bleed via runtimecall encointercommunities signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCommunities` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCommunities` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test that reorders offline-payment, reputation, and treasury actions across boundaries
