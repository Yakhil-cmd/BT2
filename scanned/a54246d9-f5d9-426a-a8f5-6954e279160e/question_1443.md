# Q1443: proxy-batched asset escape via assetconversion create pool add on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
