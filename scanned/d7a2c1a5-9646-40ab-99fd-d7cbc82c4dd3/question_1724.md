# Q1724: cross-asset accounting split via polkadotxcm send execute transfer on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
