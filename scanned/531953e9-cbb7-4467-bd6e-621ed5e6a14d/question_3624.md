# Q3624: accrue-user-debts via collateral-remove-redeem: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-underlying` across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-debts` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
