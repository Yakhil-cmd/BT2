# Q1543: swap-settlement mismatch via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects, breaking the invariant that approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects
- Invariant to test: approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
