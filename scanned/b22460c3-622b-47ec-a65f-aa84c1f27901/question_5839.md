# Q5839: vault-system-repay via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, then read `vault-system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
