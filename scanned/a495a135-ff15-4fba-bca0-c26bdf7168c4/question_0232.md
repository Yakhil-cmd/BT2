# Q232: offers via StyledHeaderBox 232

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the offer URL fetch/import flow in `StyledHeaderBox` (packages/gui/src/components/offers/OfferViewerTitle.tsx) control royalty and fee fields near zero/rounding limits through a batch of rapid user-accessible actions and drive the sequence connect -> approve -> switch context -> execute so the GUI would bypass royalty or fee accounting in the displayed confirmation, violating the invariant that previewed offered/requested assets, royalties, fees, tradeId, and expiration must equal the payload sent to wallet RPC, leading to Critical: unauthorized offer acceptance/cancellation or wrong-asset transfer; High: spoofed offer state causing approval of the wrong assets?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/gui/src/components/offers/OfferViewerTitle.tsx` / `StyledHeaderBox`
- Entrypoint: offer URL fetch/import flow
- Attacker controls: royalty and fee fields near zero/rounding limits; through a batch of rapid user-accessible actions
- Exploit idea: bypass royalty or fee accounting in the displayed confirmation
- Invariant to test: previewed offered/requested assets, royalties, fees, tradeId, and expiration must equal the payload sent to wallet RPC
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unauthorized offer acceptance/cancellation or wrong-asset transfer; High: spoofed offer state causing approval of the wrong assets
- Fast validation: fuzz canonicalization inputs and assert display, validation, and payload use the same canonical value
