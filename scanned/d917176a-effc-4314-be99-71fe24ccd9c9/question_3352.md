# Q3352: revenue-claim replay via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama runtime and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
