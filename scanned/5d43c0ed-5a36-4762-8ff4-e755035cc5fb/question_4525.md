# Q4525: accrue-debt-asset via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), drive `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) — which calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), then read `accrue-debt-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
