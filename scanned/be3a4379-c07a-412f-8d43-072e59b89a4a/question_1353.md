# Q1353: linear-interpolate via liquidate: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `collateral-receiver`, drive `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) — which interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)` — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `liquidate` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `linear-interpolate` touches, run `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
