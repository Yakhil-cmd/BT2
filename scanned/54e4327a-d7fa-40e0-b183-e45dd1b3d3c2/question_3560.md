# Q3560: resolve-or-create via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
