# Q1575: compute_cells - field-element encoding inside cells via Rust [a-blob-whose-4096-field-elements-are-all]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm each 32-byte lane in a cell is the canonical big-endian encoding of the data point (a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
- Invariant to test: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation (input: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
