# Q1458: collateral-remove via borrow: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `borrow` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `collateral-remove` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
