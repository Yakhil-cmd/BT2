# Q2819: username-expiry accounting drift via proxy proxy utility batch on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Polkadot identity config and control inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched so that `IdentityInfo / fields()` makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination, breaking the invariant that treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityInfo / fields()`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched
- Exploit idea: makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination
- Invariant to test: treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: targeted test proving whether treasury routing resolves to the expected account after adversarial input
