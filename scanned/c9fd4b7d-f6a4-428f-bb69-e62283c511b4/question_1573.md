# Q1573: migration-balance drift via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
