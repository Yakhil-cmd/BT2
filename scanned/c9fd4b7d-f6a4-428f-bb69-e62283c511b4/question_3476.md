# Q3476: alias collision on execution via coretimekusama pallet xcm execute on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
