# Q1633: destination-credit loss via poolassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}`
- Attacker controls: liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
