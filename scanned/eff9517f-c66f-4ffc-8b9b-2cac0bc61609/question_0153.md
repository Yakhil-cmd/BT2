# Q0153: unbounded response body - (Client).AddRemote in client.go

## Question
Does `AddRemote` in [git/client.go](git/client.go#L831) read the whole response body into memory without a limit, so an attacker-controlled endpoint can exhaust the victim's RAM?

## Target
- File/function: [git/client.go:831](git/client.go#L831) - `(Client).AddRemote`
- Entrypoint: gh repo clone
- Attacker controls: a repository, branch, tag, PR head ref, remote, or .gitmodules entry the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Serve a multi-gigabyte body from an attacker-controlled host or asset URL.
- Invariant to test: Response reads are wrapped in a limit reader with an explicit cap.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Unbounded resource consumption on the victim's machine from a single attacker-published object
- Fast validation: Test with a huge/endless body asserting a bounded error.
