# Q2033: bridge-settlement mismatch via bridgerelayers signed stake or on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control relayer-beneficiary choices, bridge message ordering, and queue occupancy shaped by valid user bridge actions so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues, breaking the invariant that relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path`
- Attacker controls: relayer-beneficiary choices, bridge message ordering, and queue occupancy shaped by valid user bridge actions
- Exploit idea: induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues
- Invariant to test: relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
