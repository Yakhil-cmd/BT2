# Q1348: ComputeBlobKzgProof - non-canonical commitment argument via CSharp [a-48-byte-string-with-the-infinity-flag]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the commitment used == the canonical validated point, else C_KZG_BADARGS so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: bytes_to_kzg_commitment)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass a non-canonical/inf commitment and confirm bytes_to_kzg_commitment gates it before compute_challenge (a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate).
- Invariant to test: the commitment used == the canonical validated point, else C_KZG_BADARGS.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: the commitment used == the canonical validated point, else C_KZG_BADARGS (input: a 48-byte string with the infinity flag set but a nonzero x coordinate).
