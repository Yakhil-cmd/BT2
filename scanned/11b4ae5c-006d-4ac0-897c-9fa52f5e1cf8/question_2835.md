# Q2835: new_base58_encoded is not deterministic across nodes (filter.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `new_base58_encoded` in `rpc-client-types/src/filter.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and make the slot used to answer the request disagree with the slot the requested commitment level guarantees, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `new_base58_encoded` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc-client-types/src/filter.rs` -> `new_base58_encoded()` (around line 146)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Find input to `new_base58_encoded` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `new_base58_encoded` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `new_base58_encoded` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
