# Q3989: insert via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, drive `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) — which rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
