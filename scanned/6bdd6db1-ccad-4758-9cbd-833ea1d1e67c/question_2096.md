# Q2096: queue-finalization replay via assethubpolkadot signed bridge frontend on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over message ordering, beneficiary choice, and queue state with one-settlement assertions
