# Q3531: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - column-aggregation interpolation collision via Zig [a-duplicated-index-pair-k-k-for-the-same]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that aggregated interpolation commitment == the true column polynomial iff each cell is genuine so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: aggregate crafted cells in one column so the interpolation poly matches the commitment without any single cell being valid (a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: aggregated interpolation commitment == the true column polynomial iff each cell is genuine.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: aggregated interpolation commitment == the true column polynomial iff each cell is genuine (input: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
