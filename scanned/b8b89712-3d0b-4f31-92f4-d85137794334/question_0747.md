# Q0747: zip via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `zip` touches, run `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
