# Q0821: vault-system-borrow via repay: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) — which routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
