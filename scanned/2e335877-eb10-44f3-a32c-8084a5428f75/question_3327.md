# Q3327: revenue-claim replay via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
