# Q2779: username-expiry accounting drift via identity set identity clear on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Polkadot identity config and control username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls so that `impl pallet_identity::Config` makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination, breaking the invariant that treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `impl pallet_identity::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls
- Exploit idea: makes identity slashing or refund routing resolve to an attacker-chosen local account or aliasable destination
- Invariant to test: treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
