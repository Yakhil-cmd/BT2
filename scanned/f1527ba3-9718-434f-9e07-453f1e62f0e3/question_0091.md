# Q91: account-mapping collision via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary so that `RemoteProxyInterface::local_to_remote_account_id / remote_to_local_proxy_defintion` makes local and remote proxy-type checks disagree on the effective privilege of the wrapped call, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `RemoteProxyInterface::local_to_remote_account_id / remote_to_local_proxy_defintion`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary
- Exploit idea: makes local and remote proxy-type checks disagree on the effective privilege of the wrapped call
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
