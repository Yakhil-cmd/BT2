# Q2539: status via liquidate: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `min-collateral-expected`, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `liquidate` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, then read `status` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
