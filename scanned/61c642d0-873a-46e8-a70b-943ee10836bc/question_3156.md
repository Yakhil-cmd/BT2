# Q3156: revenue-claim replay via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
