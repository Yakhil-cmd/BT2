# Q981: reward-accounting drift via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
