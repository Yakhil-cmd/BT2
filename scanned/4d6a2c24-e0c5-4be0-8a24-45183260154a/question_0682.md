# Q682: fee-asset undercharge path via xcmpallet transfer assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::transfer_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `XcmRouter` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmRouter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
