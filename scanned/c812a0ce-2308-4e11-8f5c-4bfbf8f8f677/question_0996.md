# Q0996: vault-accrue via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `vault-accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
