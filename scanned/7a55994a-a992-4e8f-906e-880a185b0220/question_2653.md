# Q2653: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - affine-compress vs bytes_from_g1 in the transcript via Java [the-g1-generator-point]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with the G1 generator point, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that transcript point bytes == the canonical commitment/proof encoding used elsewhere so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the G1 generator point. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check blst_p1_affine_compress used for the transcript equals bytes_from_g1 for every point incl. infinity (the G1 generator point).
- Invariant to test: transcript point bytes == the canonical commitment/proof encoding used elsewhere.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: transcript point bytes == the canonical commitment/proof encoding used elsewhere (input: the G1 generator point).
