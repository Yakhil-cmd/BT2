# Q3548: offline-payment double-spend via runtimecall encointertreasuries signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated, breaking the invariant that community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path
- Attacker controls: XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows
- Exploit idea: lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated
- Invariant to test: community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
