# Q0044: debt-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `debt-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
