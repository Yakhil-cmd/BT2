# Q3976: computeCells - cells match the reference implementation via Java [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.computeCells via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell bytes == the reference DAS cells for every blob so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: fr_fft)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.computeCells via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: differentially compare computeCells output against Rust-Eth-KZG for random blobs (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: cell bytes == the reference DAS cells for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: cell bytes == the reference DAS cells for every blob (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
