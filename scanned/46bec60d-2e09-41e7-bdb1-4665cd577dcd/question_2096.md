# Q2096: zip via repay: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `repay` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `zip` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
