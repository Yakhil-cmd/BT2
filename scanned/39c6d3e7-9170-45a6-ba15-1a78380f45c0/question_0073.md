# Q73: VerifyKZGProof - chosen y paired with an infinity commitment via Go [the-value-equal-to-the-bls-modulus-r-0x7]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with the value equal to the BLS modulus r (0x7300, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that an infinity commitment cannot verify an attacker-chosen (z,y) unless it truly commits to that poly so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: verify_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the value equal to the BLS modulus r (0x7300...0001) encoded big-endian. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: set commitment to infinity and pick y so [y]G1 cancels, forging p(z)=y (the value equal to the BLS modulus r (0x7300...0001) encoded big-endian).
- Invariant to test: an infinity commitment cannot verify an attacker-chosen (z,y) unless it truly commits to that poly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: an infinity commitment cannot verify an attacker-chosen (z,y) unless it truly commits to that poly (input: the value equal to the BLS modulus r (0x7300...0001) encoded big-endian).
