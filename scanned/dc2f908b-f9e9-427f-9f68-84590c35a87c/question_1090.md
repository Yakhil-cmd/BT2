# Q1090: fee-asset undercharge path via polkadotxcm teleport assets on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `HollarFromHydration` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `HollarFromHydration`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
