# Q771: compute_cells - field-element encoding inside cells via C [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm each 32-byte lane in a cell is the canonical big-endian encoding of the data point (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
