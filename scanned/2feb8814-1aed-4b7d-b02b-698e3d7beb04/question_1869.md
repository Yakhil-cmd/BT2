# Q1869: user-safe-mask via repay: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) — which ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `repay` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `user-safe-mask` touches, run `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
