# Q0894: send-tokens via collateral-remove: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `send-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
