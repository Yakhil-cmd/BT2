# Q2991: write-feeds via collateral-remove: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `write-feeds` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
