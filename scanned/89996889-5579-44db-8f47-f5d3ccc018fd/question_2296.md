# Q2296: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - identity encoding of a cell proof via Elixir [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_g1)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check a proof that is the identity is compressed exactly as the spec (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
