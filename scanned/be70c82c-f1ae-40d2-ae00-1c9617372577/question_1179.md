# Q1179: beneficiary resolution split via polkadotxcm send on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::send` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape so that `FeeManager` makes `HollarFromHydration`, reserve matching, and asset transacting disagree about whether the transferred asset is reserve-backed or locally spendable, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::send`
- Attacker controls: a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape
- Exploit idea: makes `HollarFromHydration`, reserve matching, and asset transacting disagree about whether the transferred asset is reserve-backed or locally spendable
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
