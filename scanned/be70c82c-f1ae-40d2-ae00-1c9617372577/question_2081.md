# Q2081: bridge-settlement mismatch via bridgerelayers signed stake or on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
