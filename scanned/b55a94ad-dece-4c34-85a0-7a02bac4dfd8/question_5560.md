# Q5560: compute_cells - cells differ across precompute via Rust [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: poly_lagrange_to_monomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute cells with precompute 0 and 8 and require identical bytes (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
