# Q0472: receive-underlying via liquidate-redeem: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it pulls the underlying from a named account, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
