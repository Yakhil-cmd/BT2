# Q4435: mask-to-list-internal via supply-collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, then read `mask-to-list-internal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
