# Q5126: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `convert-to-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
