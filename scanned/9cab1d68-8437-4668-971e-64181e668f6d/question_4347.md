# Q4347: touch — log volume dos under error file

## Question
Does touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state stay safe when an attacker drives high-verbosity logging (huge ref lists, fetch verbosity, hook output) in `--error-file` inside --root, read by the consumer as a health signal — or can log volume fills the node's log partition, violating “log output is bounded per sync” and producing node-level disk exhaustion affecting other workloads?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Drives high-verbosity logging (huge ref lists, fetch verbosity, hook output). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: log volume fills the node's log partition
- Invariant to test: log output is bounded per sync
- Expected Immunefi impact: node-level disk exhaustion affecting other workloads (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: break the sync deterministically and assert `/` stops returning 200 (or that the staleness is otherwise surfaced)
