# Q785: Abuse normalization ambiguity

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and choose `participants`, `wait`, `send_vote`, `protocol message timing` so `reliable_broadcast_receive_all` normalizes two semantically different `receive` states into one accepted output, enabling Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::reliable_broadcast_receive_all`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `participants`, `wait`, `send_vote`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Construct inputs that normalize to the same accepted form while representing different semantic signer or key states.
- Invariant to test: Normalization must not collapse two distinct `receive` states into one accepted result.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `receive` data into `reliable_broadcast_receive_all`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
