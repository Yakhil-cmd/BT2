# Q4387: calc-utilization via collateral-remove-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, then read `calc-utilization` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
