# Q2425: collateral-remove via supply-collateral-add: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) — which decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `collateral-remove` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
