# Q3837: query-state replay on payout via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value, breaking the invariant that query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer
- Exploit idea: lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value
- Invariant to test: query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset location, beneficiary conversion, and payment-status replay
