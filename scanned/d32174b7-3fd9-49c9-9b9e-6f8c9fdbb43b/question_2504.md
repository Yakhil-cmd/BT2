# Q2504: vault-accrue via borrow: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
