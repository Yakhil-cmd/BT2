# Q3252: CRC21 source send lock under replay attempt authorization

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public send_to_ibc(string,uint,uint,bytes) by controlling recipient, amount, channel_id, extraData, isSource and allowance when the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback, then emit IBC send event for source token without exact module_address lock so that source sends lock exactly amount before native IBC transfer fails and the authenticated signer/caller is exactly the account whose assets or authority are used, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/src/ModuleCRC21.sol::send_to_ibc
- Entrypoint: public send_to_ibc(string,uint,uint,bytes)
- Attacker controls: recipient, amount, channel_id, extraData, isSource and allowance; scenario focus: replay attempt plus authorization.
- Exploit idea: emit IBC send event for source token without exact module_address lock while the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback.
- Invariant to test: source sends lock exactly amount before native IBC transfer; also verify the authenticated signer/caller is exactly the account whose assets or authority are used.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: fuzz the controlled fields while asserting the invariant and rejecting any profitable state delta. Scoped to live HackenProof Cronos Blockchain Protocols: cryptographic flaws and vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds; excludes DoS/DDoS/spam, gas draining, leaked keys, privileged-address/admin abuse, basic governance attacks, known fork/dependency issues without a working Cronos PoC, tests, mocks, scripts, docs, disabled configs, and non-production code.
