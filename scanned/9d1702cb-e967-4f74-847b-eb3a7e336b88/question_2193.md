# Q2193: bridge-fee swap drift via snowbridgesystemfrontend signed bridge path on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot on Snowbridge runtime path and control token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow so that `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2` makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths, breaking the invariant that bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model, and leading to critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2`
- Entrypoint: `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot
- Attacker controls: token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow
- Exploit idea: makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths
- Invariant to test: bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
