# Q3529: adjust_delegation_for_rent confuses account types or owners (distribution.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `adjust_delegation_for_rent` in `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and have `adjust_delegation_for_rent` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`adjust_delegation_for_rent` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` -> `adjust_delegation_for_rent()` (around line 55)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `adjust_delegation_for_rent` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `adjust_delegation_for_rent` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `adjust_delegation_for_rent` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
