# Q1808: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - predictable r via duplicate entries via Rust [a-64-item-batch-with-exactly-one-crafted]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit byte-identical entries so their r-powers coincide and probe for a cancellation the transcript cannot bind (a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
- Invariant to test: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: the challenge r binds every entry uniquely; duplicates do not create a cancelling weight (input: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
