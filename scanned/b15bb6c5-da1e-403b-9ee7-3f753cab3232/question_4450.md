# Q4450: socialize-debt-asset via liquidate: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `socialize-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `socialize-debt-asset` calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879` -> `socialize-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt-asset` calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Reach it through `liquidate` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
