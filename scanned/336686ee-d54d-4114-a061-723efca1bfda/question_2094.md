# Q2094: bridge-path availability wedge via bridgerelayers signed stake or on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
