# Q1875: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - large-n allocation/size arithmetic via Zig [a-64-item-batch-with-exactly-one-crafted]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: drive input_size = DOMAIN + 2*u64 + n*(commit+2*fe+proof) toward size_t overflow (a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
- Invariant to test: the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs (input: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
