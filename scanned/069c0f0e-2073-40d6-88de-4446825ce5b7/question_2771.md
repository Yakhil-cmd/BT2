# Q2771: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
