# Q2270: oracle-price-legal via supply-collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) varied, and assert that the value `oracle-price-legal` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
