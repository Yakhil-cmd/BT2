# Q2161: ComputeBlobKzgProof - blob-proof determinism via CSharp [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.ComputeBlobKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm identical proof bytes across builds/precompute for a fixed blob and commitment (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference blob-proof for the same input (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
