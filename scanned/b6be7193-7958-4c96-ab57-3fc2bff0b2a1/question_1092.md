# Q1092: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - duplicate (commitment,cell_index) accepted via Zig [cell-index-63-last-data-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with cell_index 63 (last data column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok true iff every supplied cell lies on its commitment's polynomial; duplicate columns cannot average into acceptance so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 63 (last data column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit the same column index twice for one commitment with two different cells so their r-weighted sum interpolates while neither cell is valid (cell_index 63 (last data column)).
- Invariant to test: *ok true iff every supplied cell lies on its commitment's polynomial; duplicate columns cannot average into acceptance.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: *ok true iff every supplied cell lies on its commitment's polynomial; duplicate columns cannot average into acceptance (input: cell_index 63 (last data column)).
