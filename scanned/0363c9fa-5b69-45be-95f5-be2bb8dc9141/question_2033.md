# Q2033: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - zero divisor in coset division via Python [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: coset_fft)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a case where vanishing_poly_over_coset[i] is zero so fr_div hits an undefined 1/0 (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: recovery never divides by zero; a zero divisor yields BADARGS not a bogus polynomial (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
