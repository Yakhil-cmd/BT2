# Q1946: filter-out-debt-asset via borrow: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `borrow` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `filter-out-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
