# Q3884: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - emitted cell proofs self-verify via Rust [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch accepts the (commitment,index,cell,proof) tuples this function emits (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch(computeCellsAndKzgProofs(blob)) == true for every blob (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
