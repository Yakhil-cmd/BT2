# Q3103: burn-accounting drift via proxy proxy multisig as on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
