# Q4726: total-assets-preview via redeem: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `redeem` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
