# Q1690: approval or proof replay via assets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
