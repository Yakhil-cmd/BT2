# Q2732: message-export route confusion via peoplepolkadot pallet xcm execute on People Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on People Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
