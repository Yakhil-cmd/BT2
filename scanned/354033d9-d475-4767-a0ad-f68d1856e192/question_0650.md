# Q0650: send-tokens via collateral-remove-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
