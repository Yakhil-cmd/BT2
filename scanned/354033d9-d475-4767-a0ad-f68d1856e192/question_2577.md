# Q2577: check-confidence via call-ststx-ratio: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, drive `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) — which compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `check-confidence` touches, run `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
