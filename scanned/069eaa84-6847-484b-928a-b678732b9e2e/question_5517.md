# Q5517: should apply chunk epoch transition invariant

## Question

What can an unprivileged user do by creating accounts, storage growth, receipts, and transactions around epoch and protocol-version boundaries so that `should_apply_chunk` in `chain/epoch-manager/src/shard_tracker.rs` processes transactions and contract calls submitted around epoch boundaries, protocol feature activation heights, and resharding-triggering state growth along the epoch manager and shard layout selection path? User controls transactions and contract calls submitted around epoch boundaries, protocol feature activation heights, and resharding-triggering state growth -> `should_apply_chunk` processes that value during epoch finalization, validator/assignment lookup, protocol feature gating, and block/chunk validation -> the epoch-specific protocol parameters, shard layouts, validators, and feature gates are applied consistently for every block height invariant might break -> potential in-scope impact is consensus flaw, transaction manipulation, or state desynchronization under the NEAR HackenProof scope. Exploit hypothesis: an off-by-one epoch or feature gate edge can make this code validate user-controlled state transitions under the wrong protocol parameters, violating the actual protocol invariant that epoch-specific protocol parameters, shard layouts, validators, and feature gates are applied consistently for every block height.

## Target

- File/function: chain/epoch-manager/src/shard_tracker.rs:396::should_apply_chunk
- Entrypoint: transaction effects observed across epoch boundaries through chain/epoch-manager
- User-controlled input: transactions and contract calls submitted around epoch boundaries, protocol feature activation heights, and resharding-triggering state growth
- Attack path: User controls transactions and contract calls submitted around epoch boundaries, protocol feature activation heights, and resharding-triggering state growth -> public entrypoint reaches `should_apply_chunk` -> epoch finalization, validator/assignment lookup, protocol feature gating, and block/chunk validation handles the value -> invariant failure could produce consensus flaw, transaction manipulation, or state desynchronization
- Security invariant: epoch-specific protocol parameters, shard layouts, validators, and feature gates are applied consistently for every block height
- Expected bounty impact: consensus flaw, transaction manipulation, or state desynchronization
- Fast validation approach: run boundary-height tests that submit user transactions before/at/after epoch changes and compare validation paths, shard layout, gas costs, and state roots
