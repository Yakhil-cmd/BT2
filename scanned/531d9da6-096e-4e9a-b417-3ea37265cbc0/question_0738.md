# Q738: waived-execution bypass via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `TrustedTeleporters` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedTeleporters`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
