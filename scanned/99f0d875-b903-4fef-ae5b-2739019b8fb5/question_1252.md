# Q1252: waived-execution bypass via polkadotxcm send on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::send` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `PoolAssetsExchanger` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `PoolAssetsExchanger`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::send`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
