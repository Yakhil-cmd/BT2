# Q3357: coretime debit-allocation split via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Kusama runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
