# Q4782: get-egroup via collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `get-egroup` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
