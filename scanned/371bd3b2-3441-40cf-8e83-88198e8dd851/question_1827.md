# Q1827: Snowbridge export bypass via assethubpolkadot signed user path on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `Barrier` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed user path that exports or routes XCM into BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: user-controlled upstream XCM must never acquire the `RelayChainLocation`, `AssetHubLocation`, or `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` privileges reserved in Bridge Hub
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
