# Q139: account-mapping collision via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination so that `RemoteProxyInterface::local_to_remote_account_id / remote_to_local_proxy_defintion` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `RemoteProxyInterface::local_to_remote_account_id / remote_to_local_proxy_defintion`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
