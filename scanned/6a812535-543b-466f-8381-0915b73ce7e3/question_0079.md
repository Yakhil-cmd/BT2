# Q79: account-mapping collision via multisig as multi remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a proof for a proxy definition that decodes but may map to a looser local `ProxyDefinition` than intended so that `Pallet::register_remote_proxy_proof` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::register_remote_proxy_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Multisig::as_multi(remote_proxy_with_registered_proof(...))` finalized with a fresh proof
- Attacker controls: a proof for a proxy definition that decodes but may map to a looser local `ProxyDefinition` than intended
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
