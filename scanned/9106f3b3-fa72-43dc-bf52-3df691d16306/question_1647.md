# Q1647: swap-settlement mismatch via staking signed user path on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::* signed user path` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::* signed user path`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
