# Q2918: create via transfer: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, can an unprivileged attacker make `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `transfer` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury varied, and assert that the value `create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
