# Q4789: computeCells - field-element encoding inside cells via Java [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.computeCells via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.computeCells via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm each 32-byte lane in a cell is the canonical big-endian encoding of the data point (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
