# Q743: ComputeCells - cells differ across precompute via Go [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.ComputeCells (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: poly_lagrange_to_monomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.ComputeCells (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute cells with precompute 0 and 8 and require identical bytes (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
