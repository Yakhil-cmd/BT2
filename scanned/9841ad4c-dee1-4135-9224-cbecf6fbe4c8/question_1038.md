# Q1038: claim-path state divergence via staking bond unbond rebond on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
