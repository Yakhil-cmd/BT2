# Q3117: coretime debit-allocation split via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
