# Q3115: burn-accounting drift via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
