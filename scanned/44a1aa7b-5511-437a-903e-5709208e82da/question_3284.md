# Q3284: coretime debit-allocation split via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `BurnCoretimeRevenue` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `BurnCoretimeRevenue`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
