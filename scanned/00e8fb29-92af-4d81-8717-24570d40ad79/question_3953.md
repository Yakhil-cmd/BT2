# Q3953: blocked address value movement under replay attempt backing conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation by controlling tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix when the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback, then bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction so that blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings fails and escrowed, burned, minted, locked, and released amounts conserve value exactly, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: app/proposal.go::ValidateTransaction
- Entrypoint: PrepareProposal/ProcessProposal transaction validation
- Attacker controls: tx bytes, signer addresses, block-list blob and EVM/Cosmos message mix; scenario focus: replay attempt plus backing conservation.
- Exploit idea: bypass block-list checks for a fund-moving transaction while the attacker repeats a previously successful or failed packet, tx, event, or callback.
- Invariant to test: blocked addresses cannot execute withdrawals, conversions or transfers through alternate encodings; also verify escrowed, burned, minted, locked, and released amounts conserve value exactly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: replay the same transaction sequence from exported genesis and assert deterministic balances and mappings. Scoped to live HackenProof Cronos Blockchain Protocols: cryptographic flaws and vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds; excludes DoS/DDoS/spam, gas draining, leaked keys, privileged-address/admin abuse, basic governance attacks, known fork/dependency issues without a working Cronos PoC, tests, mocks, scripts, docs, disabled configs, and non-production code.
