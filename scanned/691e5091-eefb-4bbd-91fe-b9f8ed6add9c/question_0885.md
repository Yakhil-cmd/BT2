# Q885: Reuse child-channel state

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and exploit `push` so concurrently running sessions reuse a child-channel or waitpoint namespace for `child channel`, letting attacker messages cross sessions and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::push`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `header`, `from`, `message`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Run concurrent sessions with overlapping peers and cross-wire `child channel` messages between child-channel namespaces.
- Invariant to test: Concurrent sessions must not share child-channel or waitpoint identity for `child channel`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `child channel` data into `push`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
