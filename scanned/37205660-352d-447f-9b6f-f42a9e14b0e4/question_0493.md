# Q493: EIP-2930 parsing status-state split after unsigned serialization in `rlp_append_unsigned`

## Question
Can an attacker make unsigned serialization in `rlp_append_unsigned` return a status that looks like a clean failure while state, logs, or refunds have already moved in a way that can be exploited for Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_2930.rs` -> `unsigned serialization in `rlp_append_unsigned``
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-2930 access-list transaction
- Attacker controls: typed transaction bytes, access-list entries and storage keys, calldata, fees, signature values, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: force a divergence between the reported transaction status and the actual state side effects after the named subtarget.
- Invariant to test: EIP-2930 parsing must not let access-list structure change sender identity, gas charging, or state-transition meaning
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Compare returned `SubmitResult.status` with balances, logs, and storage after crafted reverts and fatal exits. add transaction parser tests and execution tests that mutate access-list order, duplication, and sizing while checking sender, gas, logs, and post-state consistency
