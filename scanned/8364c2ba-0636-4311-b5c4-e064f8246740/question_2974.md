# Q2974: confirmation skipped when non-interactive - newPrompter in default.go

## Question
Does `newPrompter` in [pkg/cmd/factory/default.go](pkg/cmd/factory/default.go#L256) skip its confirmation when stdout is not a TTY or `--yes`-style defaults apply, so an attacker-published object gets a destructive/trusting action in CI?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:256](pkg/cmd/factory/default.go#L256) - `newPrompter`
- Entrypoint: gh factory default
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Get the victim's automation to run gh factory default against attacker coordinates.
- Invariant to test: Non-interactive mode fails closed instead of auto-confirming.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Authentication/authorization bypass in gh: wrong account or host credentials used for a privileged action
- Fast validation: Test with a non-TTY IOStreams asserting an error rather than a silent yes.
