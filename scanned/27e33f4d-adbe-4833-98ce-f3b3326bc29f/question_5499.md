# Q5499: asset filename controls the write path - NewCmdReadDir in read_dir.go

## Question
Does `NewCmdReadDir` in [pkg/cmd/repo/read-dir/read_dir.go](pkg/cmd/repo/read-dir/read_dir.go#L44) build the output path from a server-supplied name (asset name, artifact name, gist filename, Content-Disposition) without sanitizing separators and traversal?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/repo/read-dir/read_dir.go:44](pkg/cmd/repo/read-dir/read_dir.go#L44) - `NewCmdReadDir`
- Entrypoint: gh repo read-dir
- Attacker controls: an asset, artifact, gist, or archive-member name and its bytes
- Exploit idea: Publish a release/artifact/gist whose file is named `../../.bashrc` and let the victim run gh repo read-dir.
- Invariant to test: Output names are sanitized to a single path element inside the chosen directory.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Arbitrary file write or overwrite outside the intended directory, escalating to code execution via startup files, git hooks, or gh's own config
- Fast validation: Table test over hostile names asserting the resolved output path.
