# Q2593: get-notional-evaluation via collateral-remove: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) — which folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `get-notional-evaluation` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
