# Q0707: lookup via liquidate: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `liquidate` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
