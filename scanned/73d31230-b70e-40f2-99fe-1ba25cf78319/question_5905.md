# Q5905: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) — which expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64 — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, then read `mask-to-list-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
