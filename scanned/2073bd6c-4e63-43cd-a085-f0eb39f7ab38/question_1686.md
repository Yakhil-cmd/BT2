# Q1686: reserve-backed asset confusion via poolassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
