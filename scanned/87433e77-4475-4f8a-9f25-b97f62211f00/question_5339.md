# Q5339: normalize-pyth via collateral-remove-redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
