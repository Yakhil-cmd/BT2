# Q3635: calc-index-next via deposit: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) applies a multiplier to the current index. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `recipient`, including a contract principal, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `deposit` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
