# Q463: RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs - all-cells-missing edge case via Go [cell-index-0-first-data-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with cell_index 0 (first data column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the edge case returns BADARGS, never an out-of-range roots_of_unity read so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.RecoverCellsAndKZGProofs (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 0 (first data column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: drive vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells toward len_missing >= CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (cell_index 0 (first data column)).
- Invariant to test: the edge case returns BADARGS, never an out-of-range roots_of_unity read.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: the edge case returns BADARGS, never an out-of-range roots_of_unity read (input: cell_index 0 (first data column)).
