# Q3909: blob_to_kzg_commitment - commitment via the zero-point filter in g1_lincomb_fast via Python [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.blob_to_kzg_commitment via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: g1_lincomb_fast)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.blob_to_kzg_commitment via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply a blob so that g1_lincomb_fast's `blst_p1_is_inf` filter drops coefficients and yields the identity commitment while the polynomial is non-zero (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: the returned commitment == the true MSM of g1_values_lagrange_brp with the blob polynomial, never the identity for a non-zero poly (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
