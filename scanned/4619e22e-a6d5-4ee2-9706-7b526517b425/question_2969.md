# Q2969: notify_new_root_slots is not deterministic across nodes (optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `notify_new_root_slots` in `rpc/src/optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs` with two distinct inputs chosen so the digest input is ambiguous (missing domain separation), and make the response size bound applied to the request disagree with the on-chain data the response actually walks, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `notify_new_root_slots` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs` -> `notify_new_root_slots()` (around line 260)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: two distinct inputs chosen so the digest input is ambiguous (missing domain separation)
- Exploit idea: Find input to `notify_new_root_slots` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `notify_new_root_slots` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `notify_new_root_slots` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
