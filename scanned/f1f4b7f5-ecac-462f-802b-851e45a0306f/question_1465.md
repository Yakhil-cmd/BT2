# Q1465: destination-credit loss via staking signed user path on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::* signed user path` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::* signed user path`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
