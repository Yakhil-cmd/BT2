# Q3821: query-state replay on payout via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout help

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways so that `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
