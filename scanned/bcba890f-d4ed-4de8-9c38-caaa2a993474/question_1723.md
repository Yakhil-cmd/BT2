# Q1723: proxy-batched asset escape via poolassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `PoolAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
