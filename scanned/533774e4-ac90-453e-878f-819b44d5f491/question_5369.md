# Q5369: remove-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `collateral-receiver`, drive `remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) — which deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `liquidate` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `collateral-receiver`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
