# Q5700: zip via collateral-remove-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
