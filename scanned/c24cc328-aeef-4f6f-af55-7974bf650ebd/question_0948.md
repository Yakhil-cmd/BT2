# Q0948: get-full-position via collateral-remove: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `get-full-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
