# Q3641: community-treasury drift via runtimecall encointerceremonies signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state, breaking the invariant that community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state
- Invariant to test: community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test that reorders offline-payment, reputation, and treasury actions across boundaries
