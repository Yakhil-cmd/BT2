# Q3802: remote-payout beneficiary split via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions so that `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset location, beneficiary conversion, and payment-status replay
