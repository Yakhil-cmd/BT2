# Q3979: repoSync.isShallow — short hash ambiguity under nodepth after depth

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who pushes objects engineered to share a short-hash prefix with the pinned revision, under a deployment where --depth was previously set and is now 0, so the --unshallow path is live, reach a state where — in the shallowness probe isShallow() and its `--unshallow` decision — any abbreviated-hash handling in rev-parse output or worktree naming resolves to the attacker's object, breaking the invariant that object identity is always resolved at full length and yielding unauthorized content published to consumers?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.isShallow`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Pushes objects engineered to share a short-hash prefix with the pinned revision. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: any abbreviated-hash handling in rev-parse output or worktree naming resolves to the attacker's object
- Invariant to test: object identity is always resolved at full length
- Expected Immunefi impact: unauthorized content published to consumers (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: unit-test the resolution path with a fixture repo and assert the resolved hash equals `git rev-parse <ref>` on the server
