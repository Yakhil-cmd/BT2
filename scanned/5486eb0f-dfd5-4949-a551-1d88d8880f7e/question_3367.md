# Q3367: burn-accounting drift via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama runtime and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased, breaking the invariant that every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased
- Invariant to test: every unit of purchased or transferred coretime must be backed by exactly one debit and one allocation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
