# Q3729: calc-treasury-lp-preview via transfer: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, drive `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) — which divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `transfer` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-treasury-lp-preview` touches, run `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
