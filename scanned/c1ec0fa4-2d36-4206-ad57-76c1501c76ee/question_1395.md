# Q1395: alias collision on execution via polkadotxcm limited reserve transfer on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `TrustedAliasers` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedAliasers`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
