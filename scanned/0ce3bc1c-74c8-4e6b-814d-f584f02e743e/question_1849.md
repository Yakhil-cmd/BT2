# Q1849: Snowbridge export bypass via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes `DenyExportMessageFrom`, `MessageExporter` ordering, or `LocationAsSuperuser` disagree with the origin and destination the runtime actually uses, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes `DenyExportMessageFrom`, `MessageExporter` ordering, or `LocationAsSuperuser` disagree with the origin and destination the runtime actually uses
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
