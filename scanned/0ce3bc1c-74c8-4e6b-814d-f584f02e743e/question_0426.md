# Q426: message-export route confusion via xcmpallet teleport assets on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `XcmRouter` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmRouter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
