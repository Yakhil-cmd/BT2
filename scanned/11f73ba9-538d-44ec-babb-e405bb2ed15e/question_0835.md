# Q835: EIP-4844 parsing multi-tx amplification through blob-style fee field decoding

## Question
Can an attacker batch or sequence many small transactions through `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-4844 transaction path so that blob-style fee field decoding applies a rounding, caching, or accounting shortcut that compounds into Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_4844.rs` -> `blob-style fee field decoding`
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-4844 transaction path
- Attacker controls: typed transaction bytes, blob-related fee fields, calldata, recipient/create choice, signature values, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: amplify a per-call discrepancy at the subtarget across many user-controlled transactions.
- Invariant to test: EIP-4844 parsing must not let blob-style fee or envelope fields desynchronize gas accounting from execution intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Run a high-count local sequence with tiny value and gas variations, then compare cumulative balances and fees against expected totals. add parser tests plus local execution tests that mutate typed-envelope and fee fields and check sender, fee charge, refund, and resulting state
