# Q3079: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - cells+proofs match the reference via Elixir [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that (cells,proofs) bytes == the reference output for every blob so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: differentially compare against Rust-Eth-KZG for random blobs (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: (cells,proofs) bytes == the reference output for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: (cells,proofs) bytes == the reference output for every blob (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
