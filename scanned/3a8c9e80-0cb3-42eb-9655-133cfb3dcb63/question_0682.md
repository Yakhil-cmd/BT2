# Q682: EIP-1559 parsing partial-failure replay around sender recovery in `sender()`

## Question
Can an attacker use `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-1559 transaction with EIP-1559 fee fields, gas limit, access list, calldata, value, signature values, and relayer choice to push sender recovery in `sender()` through a partial-failure path, then replay or retry the same user-intent so one branch keeps side effects while the retry reuses the original value or nonce budget, leading to Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine-transactions/src/eip_1559.rs` -> `sender recovery in `sender()``
- Entrypoint: `submit()` / `submit_with_args()` with an EIP-1559 transaction
- Attacker controls: EIP-1559 fee fields, gas limit, access list, calldata, value, signature values, and relayer choice
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure or retry boundary so the targeted transaction component is observed twice under inconsistent state.
- Invariant to test: EIP-1559 fee semantics must remain aligned between parsing, gas charging, refunding, and execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Drive one call into a controlled revert or async failure edge, replay the same request, and assert balance, nonce, and relayer reward remain single-applied. add integration tests that target EIP-1559 fee extremes and assert `charge_gas` and `refund_unused_gas` preserve the expected sender and relayer balances
