# Q124: verifyBlobKzgProof - zero blob acceptance via Java [precompute-0-versus-precompute-8-loaded]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProof via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok true iff the commitment/proof are the genuine ones for the zero polynomial so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProof via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify an all-zero blob against a crafted commitment/proof pair (precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
- Invariant to test: *ok true iff the commitment/proof are the genuine ones for the zero polynomial.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: *ok true iff the commitment/proof are the genuine ones for the zero polynomial (input: precompute=0 versus precompute=8 loaded from the same setup).
