# Q2942: terminal command injection via escape - ExtractHeader in http_client.go

## Question
Can attacker-supplied text rendered by `ExtractHeader` in [api/http_client.go](api/http_client.go#L175) carry sequences that terminals execute or auto-report (OSC 8 with a non-http URI, bracketed-paste break, title-set-then-report), turning display into command execution?

## Target
- File/function: [api/http_client.go:175](api/http_client.go#L175) - `ExtractHeader`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated command against attacker-influenced coordinates (gh api, gh pr list, gh repo view -R ...)
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Embed the payload in a PR title/body/check output the victim displays.
- Invariant to test: Only a safe subset of styling is emitted; hyperlinks are restricted to http(s).
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Remote code execution on the victim's developer machine (GitHub Bug Bounty: RCE in gh; Immunefi 'Websites and Apps' class: arbitrary code execution)
- Fast validation: Test asserting rendered hyperlinks/URIs are scheme-checked and controls stripped.
