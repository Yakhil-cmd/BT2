# Q0818: call-liquidate via liquidate-multi: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) varied, and assert that the value `call-liquidate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
