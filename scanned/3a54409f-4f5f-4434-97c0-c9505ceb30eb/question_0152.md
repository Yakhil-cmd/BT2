# Q152: stale proof replay via register remote proxy proof on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `register_remote_proxy_proof + remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` in one transaction on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary so that `Pallet::do_remote_proxy` resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::do_remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `register_remote_proxy_proof + remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` in one transaction
- Attacker controls: a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary
- Exploit idea: resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
