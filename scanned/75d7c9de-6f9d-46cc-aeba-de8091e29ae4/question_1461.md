# Q1461: migration-balance drift via assetconversion create pool add on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_tx_payment::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens, swap_tokens_for_exact_tokens}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
