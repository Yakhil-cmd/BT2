# Q0041: last_timestamp is not deterministic across nodes (vote_state_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `last_timestamp` in `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make the rent-exempt minimum enforced on write disagree with the account size actually written, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `last_timestamp` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` -> `last_timestamp()` (around line 174)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Find input to `last_timestamp` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `last_timestamp` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `last_timestamp` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
