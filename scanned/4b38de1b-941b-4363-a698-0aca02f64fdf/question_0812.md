# Q0812: update_active_set can strand user funds permanently (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `update_active_set` in `reserved-account-keys/src/lib.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and drive the target account into a state that no later instruction will accept, so that the invariant "Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `reserved-account-keys/src/lib.rs` -> `update_active_set()` (around line 86)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Drive an account through `update_active_set` into a state no subsequent instruction accepts, so the owner can never withdraw.
- Invariant to test: Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Exhaustive state-machine test over `update_active_set`'s transitions; assert every reachable state has a path back to a withdrawable state.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can permanently lock a victim's stake, vote, or nonce account by driving it into a state no instruction can exit, or by breaking rent-exempt or account-size invariants.
