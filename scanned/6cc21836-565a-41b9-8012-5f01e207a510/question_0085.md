# Q0085: repoSync.initRepo — gitmodules ext url under submodules off

## Question
Starting from `--submodules=off`, where the operator believes no submodule content is fetched, can an attacker who commits `.gitmodules` with a `url = ext::sh -c <payload>` transport entry drive the origin remote that relative-path submodules resolve against, set in initRepo() to a state where `submodule update --init` invokes the ext transport helper, running the attacker's command inside the git-sync container, defeating “no repo-supplied string is ever executed as a command” and causing remote code execution in the git-sync container holding repo credentials?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.initRepo`
- Entrypoint: attacker-committed `.gitmodules` -> `submodule update --init` inside configureWorktree()
- Attacker controls: Commits `.gitmodules` with a `url = ext::sh -c <payload>` transport entry. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: `submodule update --init` invokes the ext transport helper, running the attacker's command inside the git-sync container
- Invariant to test: no repo-supplied string is ever executed as a command
- Expected Immunefi impact: remote code execution in the git-sync container holding repo credentials (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: host the fixture superproject and submodule locally and assert `submodule update` spawns no process other than git and contacts no host but the configured remote
