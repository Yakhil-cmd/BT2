# Q1135: call() multi-tx amplification through borsh decoding of `CallArgs`

## Question
Can an attacker batch or sequence many small transactions through `call()` on the Aurora engine contract so that borsh decoding of `CallArgs` applies a rounding, caching, or accounting shortcut that compounds into Temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::call -> engine/src/engine.rs::call_with_args / call` -> `borsh decoding of `CallArgs``
- Entrypoint: `call()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: borsh `CallArgs`, target contract address, calldata, attached value, and repeated call ordering
- Exploit idea: amplify a per-call discrepancy at the subtarget across many user-controlled transactions.
- Invariant to test: direct EVM call entry must preserve the same balance, gas, authorization, and state-commit invariants as transaction submission
- Expected Immunefi impact: Temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Run a high-count local sequence with tiny value and gas variations, then compare cumulative balances and fees against expected totals. write a Rust integration test that invokes `call()` with crafted `CallArgs`, including edge-case values and calldata, and checks status, logs, balances, and storage
