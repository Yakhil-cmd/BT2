# Q2003: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - cell_index at/above the column bound via Python [cell-index-64-first-extension-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with cell_index 64 (first extension column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that every cell_index < CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB before is_cell_used/aggregation indexes by it so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 64 (first extension column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit cell_index == CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB and confirm the `>= CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB` guard fires before any indexing (cell_index 64 (first extension column)).
- Invariant to test: every cell_index < CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB before is_cell_used/aggregation indexes by it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: every cell_index < CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB before is_cell_used/aggregation indexes by it (input: cell_index 64 (first extension column)).
