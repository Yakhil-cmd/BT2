# Q4219: oracle-last-update via liquidate-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, then read `oracle-last-update` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
