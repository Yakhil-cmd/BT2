# Q2715: get-available-assets via collateral-remove-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-available-assets` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
