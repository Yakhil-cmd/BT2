# Q0253: report_loaded_programs_stats can be driven into unbounded work (metrics.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `report_loaded_programs_stats` in `runtime/src/bank/metrics.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and make `report_loaded_programs_stats` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `report_loaded_programs_stats` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/metrics.rs` -> `report_loaded_programs_stats()` (around line 228)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `report_loaded_programs_stats` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `report_loaded_programs_stats` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `report_loaded_programs_stats` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
