# Q1657: destination-credit loss via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: asset identity must stay stable across Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, and XCM
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
