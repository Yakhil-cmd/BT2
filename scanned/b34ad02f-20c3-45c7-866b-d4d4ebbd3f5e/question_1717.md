# Q1717: migration-balance drift via foreignassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
