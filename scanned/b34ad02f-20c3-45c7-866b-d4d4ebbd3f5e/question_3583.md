# Q3583: reputation-consumption replay via polkadotxcm execute send on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on Encointer runtime and control offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally, and leading to high - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
