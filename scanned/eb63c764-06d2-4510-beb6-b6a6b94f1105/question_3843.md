# Q3843: remote-transfer success drift via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout hel

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to high - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
