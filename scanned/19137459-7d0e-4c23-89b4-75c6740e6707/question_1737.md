# Q1737: destination-credit loss via assets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
