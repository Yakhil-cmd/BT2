# Q3519: confirmation skipped when non-interactive - chooseCodespaceFromList in common.go

## Question
Does `chooseCodespaceFromList` in [pkg/cmd/codespace/common.go](pkg/cmd/codespace/common.go#L93) skip its confirmation when stdout is not a TTY or `--yes`-style defaults apply, so an attacker-published object gets a destructive/trusting action in CI?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/codespace/common.go:93](pkg/cmd/codespace/common.go#L93) - `chooseCodespaceFromList`
- Entrypoint: gh codespace common
- Attacker controls: codespace/API response fields and everything the codespace-side process sends back
- Exploit idea: Get the victim's automation to run gh codespace common against attacker coordinates.
- Invariant to test: Non-interactive mode fails closed instead of auto-confirming.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Authentication/authorization bypass in gh: wrong account or host credentials used for a privileged action
- Fast validation: Test with a non-TTY IOStreams asserting an error rather than a silent yes.
