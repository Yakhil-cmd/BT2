# Q1170: fee-asset undercharge path via polkadotxcm teleport assets on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `Barrier` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
