# Q2559: query or topic reuse via collectivespolkadot pallet xcm execute on Collectives Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin / ExecuteXcmOrigin` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
