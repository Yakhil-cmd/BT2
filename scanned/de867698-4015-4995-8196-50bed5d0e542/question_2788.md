# Q2788: sub-account deposit leak via proxy proxy utility batch on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Polkadot identity config and control identity metadata, username state, and sub-account deposit sizing around repeated set and clear operations so that `IdentityInfo / fields()` creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated, breaking the invariant that encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityInfo / fields()`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: identity metadata, username state, and sub-account deposit sizing around repeated set and clear operations
- Exploit idea: creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated
- Invariant to test: encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: targeted test proving whether treasury routing resolves to the expected account after adversarial input
