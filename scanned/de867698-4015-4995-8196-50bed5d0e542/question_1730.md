# Q1730: approval or proof replay via proxy proxy multisig as on Asset Hub Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Asset Hub Kusama runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit, breaking the invariant that batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: makes two asset subsystems disagree about which pallet owns, mints, burns, or escrows the same economic unit
- Invariant to test: batching and proxying must not widen permissions on asset movement or treasury-affecting flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
