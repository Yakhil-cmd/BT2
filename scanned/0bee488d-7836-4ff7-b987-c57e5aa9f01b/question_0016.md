# Q16: stale proof replay via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::remote_proxy` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants, and leading to critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
