# Q0380: get-account-scaled-debt via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it reads one scaled debt row, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `get-account-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
