# Q2600: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - batch cancellation of an invalid triple via C [a-single-item-batch-n-1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with a single-item batch (n == 1), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch verdict == AND of the per-triple verdicts; no linear combination cancels a forgery so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a single-item batch (n == 1). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft two triples whose r-weighted contributions cancel so a forged triple passes inside the batch (a single-item batch (n == 1)).
- Invariant to test: batch verdict == AND of the per-triple verdicts; no linear combination cancels a forgery.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: batch verdict == AND of the per-triple verdicts; no linear combination cancels a forgery (input: a single-item batch (n == 1)).
