# Q4800: refresh via supply-collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `refresh` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
