# Q2996: origin-conversion mismatch via peoplekusama pallet xcm execute on People Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeopleKusama::pallet_xcm::execute` on People Kusama XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `LocationToAccountId` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `PeopleKusama::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
