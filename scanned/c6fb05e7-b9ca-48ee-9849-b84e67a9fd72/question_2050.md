# Q2050: merge-price via liquidate-multi: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
