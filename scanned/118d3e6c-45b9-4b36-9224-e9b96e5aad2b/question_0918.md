# Q918: claim-path state divergence via xcmpallet execute send limited on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
