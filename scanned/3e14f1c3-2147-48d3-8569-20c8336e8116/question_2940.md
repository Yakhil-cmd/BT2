# Q2940: compute_blob_kzg_proof - in-domain challenge handling via C [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that compute_blob_kzg_proof output == a proof accepted by verify_blob_kzg_proof for the same blob/commitment so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: compute_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose derived challenge equals a domain root and confirm the resulting proof still verifies against this library (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: compute_blob_kzg_proof output == a proof accepted by verify_blob_kzg_proof for the same blob/commitment.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: compute_blob_kzg_proof output == a proof accepted by verify_blob_kzg_proof for the same blob/commitment (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
