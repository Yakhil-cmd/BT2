# Q4660: calc-treasury-lp-preview via accrue: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `accrue` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
