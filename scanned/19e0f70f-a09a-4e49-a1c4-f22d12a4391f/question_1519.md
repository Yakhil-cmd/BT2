# Q1519: filter_obsolete_accounts confuses account types or owners (obsolete_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `filter_obsolete_accounts` in `accounts-db/src/obsolete_accounts.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and have `filter_obsolete_accounts` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`filter_obsolete_accounts` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/obsolete_accounts.rs` -> `filter_obsolete_accounts()` (around line 39)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `filter_obsolete_accounts` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `filter_obsolete_accounts` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `filter_obsolete_accounts` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
