# Q2768: total-assets-preview via redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance varied, and assert that the value `total-assets-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
