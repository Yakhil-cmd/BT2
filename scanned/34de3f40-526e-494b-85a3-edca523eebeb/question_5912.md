# Q5912: vault-accrue via collateral-remove-redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `receiver` for the underlying leg varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
