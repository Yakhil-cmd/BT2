# Q1185: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - cell-batch r predictable before proofs via Rust [a-3-item-batch-containing-two-byte-ident]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check compute_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch_challenge binds commitments, indices, cells and proofs so r cannot be gamed (a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
- Invariant to test: r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: r == H(all inputs); proofs cannot be chosen after r is known (input: a 3-item batch containing two byte-identical entries).
