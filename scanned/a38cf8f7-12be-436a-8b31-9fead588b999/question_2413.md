# Q2413: Swap participant ordering

## Question
Can a malicious participant below threshold enter through `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` with crafted `transcript`, `statement`, `proof` and exploit `verify` so participant ordering or identifier mapping for `forked transcript` differs across nodes, breaking signer-set consistency and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/crypto/proofs/dlog.rs::verify`
- Entrypoint: `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `transcript`, `statement`, `proof`
- Exploit idea: Reorder or relabel participant-specific `forked transcript` values and look for divergent Lagrange or identifier handling.
- Invariant to test: Participant identifiers, ordering, and Lagrange weights must map 1:1 to the intended signer set.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Construct a deterministic unit or invariant test around `crypto::proofs::dlog::verify` that feeds crafted `forked transcript` / `challenge-derived RNG` inputs, then assert whether downstream verification accepts an output that should have been rejected.
