# Q3244: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via signed user flow that on Coretime Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Polkadot through valid upstream XCM` on Coretime Polkadot XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Polkadot through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
