# Q2128: queue-finalization replay via bridgerelayers signed stake or on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: lets a user-triggered bridge path finalize a credit or unlock before the matching queue, proof, or export state is uniquely bound
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
