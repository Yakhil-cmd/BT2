# Q3845: query-state replay on payout via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout help

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of treasury funds
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
