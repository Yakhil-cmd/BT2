# Q3536: offline-payment double-spend via runtimecall encointerbalances or encointerofflinepayment on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control community ids, ceremony indices, meetup references, and participant-controlled reputation artifacts so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes community balances, treasuries, and reputation state disagree about which value was already spent or earned, breaking the invariant that each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context, and leading to high - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerBalances` or `EncointerOfflinePayment` signed user path
- Attacker controls: community ids, ceremony indices, meetup references, and participant-controlled reputation artifacts
- Exploit idea: makes community balances, treasuries, and reputation state disagree about which value was already spent or earned
- Invariant to test: each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
