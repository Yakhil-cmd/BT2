# Q2656: calc-index-next via deposit: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient`, including a contract principal reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `deposit` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
