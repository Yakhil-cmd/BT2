# Q3157: computeCells - cells differ across precompute via Nim [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.computeCells (used by Nimbus)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: poly_lagrange_to_monomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.computeCells (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute cells with precompute 0 and 8 and require identical bytes (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: cell bytes == the reference cells for the same blob regardless of precompute/build (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
