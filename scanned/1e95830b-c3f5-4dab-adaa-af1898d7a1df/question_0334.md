# Q0334: write-feeds via liquidate-multi: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
