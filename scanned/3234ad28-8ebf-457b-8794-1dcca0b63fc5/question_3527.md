# Q3527: reputation-consumption replay via runtimecall encointerceremonies signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules, and leading to high - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerCeremonies` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched calls spanning balances, ceremonies, treasuries, bazaar, and democracy modules
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: batched or proxied execution must not let a user bypass ceremony or community isolation rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe degradation or halt of a critical community-payment path
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over the exact community, ceremony, and payout sequence with balance and reputation assertions
