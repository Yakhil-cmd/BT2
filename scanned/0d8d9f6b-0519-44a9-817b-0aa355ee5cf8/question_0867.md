# Q867: cross-pallet hold mismatch via xcmpallet execute send limited on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
