# Q1408: waived-execution bypass via polkadotxcm send on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::send` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `AssetTransactors` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `AssetTransactors`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
