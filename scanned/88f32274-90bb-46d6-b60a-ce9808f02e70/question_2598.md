# Q2598: beneficiary resolution split via collectivespolkadot pallet xcm execute on Collectives Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `Aliasers` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
