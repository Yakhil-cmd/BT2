# Q3669: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - strict-ascending index check via Python [a-duplicated-index-pair-k-k-for-the-same]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit indices that are not strictly ascending and confirm the C_KZG_BADARGS guard fires before any write (a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr (input: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
