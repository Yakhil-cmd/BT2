# Q0573: repoSync.SetupGitSSH — cred url scope widening under cookie file

## Question
Does SetupGitSSH()'s `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND` string building, SetupCookieFile(), and the redaction helpers redactURL()/logSafeFlags() stay safe when an attacker arranges the effective credential URL to be broader than intended (scheme-only or host-only after redirect) in `--cookie-file` enabled — or can git matches the stored credential against attacker-chosen paths on the same host, violating “credential matching is path-exact for the configured repo” and producing credential disclosure / unauthorized repository access?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupGitSSH / SetupCookieFile / redactURL / logSafeFlags`
- Entrypoint: attacker-controlled repo content or redirect target -> refreshCreds()/credential helper during the sync
- Attacker controls: Arranges the effective credential URL to be broader than intended (scheme-only or host-only after redirect). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: git matches the stored credential against attacker-chosen paths on the same host
- Invariant to test: credential matching is path-exact for the configured repo
- Expected Immunefi impact: credential disclosure / unauthorized repository access (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: grep logs and --error-file after the failure path and assert no secret or secret-derived value appears
