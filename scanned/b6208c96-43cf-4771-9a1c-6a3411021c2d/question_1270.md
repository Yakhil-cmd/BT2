# Q1270: call() fee ceiling gap in state application through `apply(values, .., true)`

## Question
Can an attacker choose gas fields through `call()` on the Aurora engine contract so that state application through `apply(values, .., true)` enforces one fee ceiling while the later charging or refund path uses another, resulting in free execution or excess balance burn and thus Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `engine/src/contract_methods/evm_transactions.rs::call -> engine/src/engine.rs::call_with_args / call` -> `state application through `apply(values, .., true)``
- Entrypoint: `call()` on the Aurora engine contract
- Attacker controls: borsh `CallArgs`, target contract address, calldata, attached value, and repeated call ordering
- Exploit idea: split fee-ceiling enforcement from actual gas payment semantics at the targeted stage.
- Invariant to test: direct EVM call entry must preserve the same balance, gas, authorization, and state-commit invariants as transaction submission
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Fuzz `max_fee_per_gas`, priority fee, gas limit, and any max-gas-price cap while checking exact sender and relayer deltas. write a Rust integration test that invokes `call()` with crafted `CallArgs`, including edge-case values and calldata, and checks status, logs, balances, and storage
