# Q3324: coretime debit-allocation split via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `BurnCoretimeRevenue` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `BurnCoretimeRevenue`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
