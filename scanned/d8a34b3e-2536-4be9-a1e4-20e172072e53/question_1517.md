# Q1517: register_hash is not deterministic across nodes (blockhash_queue.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `register_hash` in `accounts-db/src/blockhash_queue.rs` with an element set that hashes order-dependently when it should be order-independent, and make the lamports summed into capitalization disagree with the lamports stored across account entries, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `register_hash` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/blockhash_queue.rs` -> `register_hash()` (around line 134)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an element set that hashes order-dependently when it should be order-independent
- Exploit idea: Find input to `register_hash` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `register_hash` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `register_hash` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
