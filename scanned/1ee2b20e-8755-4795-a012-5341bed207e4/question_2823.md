# Q2823: approval-settlement split via assettxpayment signed fee paying on People Polkadot asset config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetTxPayment` signed fee-paying path on People Polkadot asset config and control approval-based asset movement combined with fee payment in the same call bundle so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` causes `HollarFromHydration`, asset conversion, and transfer logic to classify the same asset differently across the path, breaking the invariant that asset-based fee payment must not debit less value than the chain settles or executes against, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/assets.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetTxPayment` signed fee-paying path
- Attacker controls: approval-based asset movement combined with fee payment in the same call bundle
- Exploit idea: causes `HollarFromHydration`, asset conversion, and transfer logic to classify the same asset differently across the path
- Invariant to test: asset-based fee payment must not debit less value than the chain settles or executes against
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset movement
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset id, approval, and fee-asset combinations
