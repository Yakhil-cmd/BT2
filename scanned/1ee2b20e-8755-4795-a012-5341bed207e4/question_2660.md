# Q2660: identity-deposit drift via assets transfer transfer approved on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}` on People Polkadot runtime and control asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that identity deposits and refunds must always reconcile with the final asset balances, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: identity deposits and refunds must always reconcile with the final asset balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or proxy test if the path depends on aliased locations or nested execution
