# Q1549: migration-balance drift via nominationpools join bond extra on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
