# Q765: reward-accounting drift via proxy proxy multisig as on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: unlocking state, holds, and reserves must stay consistent across all touched pallets
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
