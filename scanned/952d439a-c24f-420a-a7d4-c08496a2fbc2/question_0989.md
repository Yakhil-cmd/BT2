# Q989: reward-accounting drift via claims claim claim attest on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
