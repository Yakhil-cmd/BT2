# Q898: unlock-ordering mismatch via nominationpools join bond extra on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering
- Exploit idea: forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
