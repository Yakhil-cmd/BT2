# Q4556: send-tokens via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
