# Q3458: beneficiary resolution split via coretimekusama pallet xcm execute on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `Barrier` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
