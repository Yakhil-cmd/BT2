# Q0363: receive-tokens via collateral-remove-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) pulls an asset from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `receiver` for the underlying leg, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `receive-tokens` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
