# Q5517: resolve-interpolation-points via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) — which selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-interpolation-points` touches, run `collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
