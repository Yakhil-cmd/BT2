# Q5951: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - coset-shift index collision via Elixir [a-non-ascending-pair-that-violates-the-s]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: get_inv_coset_shift_for_cell)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: find two cell indices whose reverse_bits_limited coset factor maps to the same roots_of_unity shift (a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check).
- Invariant to test: each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift (input: a non-ascending pair that violates the strict-order check).
