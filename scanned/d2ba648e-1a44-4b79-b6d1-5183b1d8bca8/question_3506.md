# Q3506: cross-ceremony state bleed via runtimecall encointertreasuries signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context, and leading to critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{EncointerScheduler, EncointerCeremonies, EncointerCommunities, EncointerBalances, EncointerBazaar, EncointerReputationCommitments, EncointerFaucet, EncointerTreasuries, EncointerOfflinePayment, EncointerReputationRings}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path
- Attacker controls: offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over the exact community, ceremony, and payout sequence with balance and reputation assertions
