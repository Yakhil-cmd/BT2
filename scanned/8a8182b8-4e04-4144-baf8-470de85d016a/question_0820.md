# Q0820: get-available-assets via redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
