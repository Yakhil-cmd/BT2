# Q2940: total-assets via transfer: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `transfer` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `total-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
