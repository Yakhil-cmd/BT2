# Q5458: interpolate-rate via deposit: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `deposit` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
