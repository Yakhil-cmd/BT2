# Q3154: ubalance via redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `min-out`, can an unprivileged attacker make `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `min-out`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
