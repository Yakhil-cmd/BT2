# Q5832: ReRun — http conn exhaust under shared volume

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who opens many slow connections to the HTTP endpoint, under a shared volume read by a co-tenant container, reach a state where — in the PID-1 shim: re-exec of /proc/self/exe, signal forwarding, and child reaping — `http.Serve` with no timeouts holds goroutines and file descriptors until the process degrades, breaking the invariant that the diagnostic server cannot exhaust process resources and yielding sidecar denial of service: updates stop?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/pid1/pid1.go](pkg/pid1/pid1.go) — `ReRun / runInit / sigchld`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Opens many slow connections to the HTTP endpoint. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: `http.Serve` with no timeouts holds goroutines and file descriptors until the process degrades
- Invariant to test: the diagnostic server cannot exhaust process resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: sidecar denial of service: updates stop (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: curl the bound port from an unauthorized context and assert nothing sensitive (argv, profiles, counters) is returned
