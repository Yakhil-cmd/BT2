# Q1369: repoSync.fetch — force push rollback under nodepth after depth

## Question
Does the argv assembled in fetch() (`fetch <repo> <ref> --verbose --no-progress --prune --no-auto-gc` plus --depth/--unshallow/--filter) stay safe when an attacker force-pushes the tracked branch back to an older commit that contains previously-patched code in a deployment where --depth was previously set and is now 0, so the --unshallow path is live — or can git-sync treats the rollback as a normal change and republishes vulnerable content while metrics and readiness report a clean sync, violating “published content only moves to revisions the ref legitimately points at, and rollbacks are observable” and producing downgrade of consumer code to a known-vulnerable revision?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.fetch`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Force-pushes the tracked branch back to an older commit that contains previously-patched code. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: git-sync treats the rollback as a normal change and republishes vulnerable content while metrics and readiness report a clean sync
- Invariant to test: published content only moves to revisions the ref legitimately points at, and rollbacks are observable
- Expected Immunefi impact: downgrade of consumer code to a known-vulnerable revision (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: stand up a local bare repo (file:// or `git daemon`), reproduce the ref/object shape, run git-sync for two periods and diff `readlink <link>` against the ref's real tip
