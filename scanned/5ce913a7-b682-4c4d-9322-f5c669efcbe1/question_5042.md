# Q5042: subset via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `subset` tests bitmask containment, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `subset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
