# Q3378: proxy-batched broker escape via proxy proxy multisig as on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls on Coretime Kusama runtime and control signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around Broker calls
- Attacker controls: signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes user debits, relay-side crediting, and local core allocation disagree about how much paid coretime was actually purchased
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
