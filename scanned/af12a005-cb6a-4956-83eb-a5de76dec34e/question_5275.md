# Q5275: get-account-scaled-debt via borrow: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) reads one scaled debt row. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `borrow` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, then read `get-account-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
