# Q2791: write-feed via borrow: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `borrow` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `write-feed` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
