# Q32: stale proof replay via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control multiple registered proofs whose LIFO consumption order can be attacker-shaped through nested dispatch so that `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close, and leading to critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: multiple registered proofs whose LIFO consumption order can be attacker-shaped through nested dispatch
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: revocation or expiry on the remote side must become locally unexploitable once the retention window is supposed to close
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
