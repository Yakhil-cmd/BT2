# Q2230: token-registration mismatch via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `XcmMessageProcessor` routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class, breaking the invariant that Ethereum-facing locations and local beneficiaries must not collide or resolve inconsistently, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `XcmMessageProcessor`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class
- Invariant to test: Ethereum-facing locations and local beneficiaries must not collide or resolve inconsistently
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
