# Q4461: truncation hides the security-relevant part - syncLocalRepo in sync.go

## Question
Does `syncLocalRepo` in [pkg/cmd/repo/sync/sync.go](pkg/cmd/repo/sync/sync.go#L99) truncate or column-fit remote text such that a host, URL, or repo name shown for a trust decision is cut, letting a lookalike be mistaken for the real one?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/repo/sync/sync.go:99](pkg/cmd/repo/sync/sync.go#L99) - `syncLocalRepo`
- Entrypoint: gh repo sync
- Attacker controls: a repository, branch, tag, PR head ref, remote, or .gitmodules entry the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Use a very long owner/host prefix so the visible portion reads as github.com.
- Invariant to test: Security-relevant identifiers are never elided; they are shown in full or the action aborts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Terminal output/prompt spoofing leading to credential capture or unintended destructive confirmation
- Fast validation: Test with a long hostile name asserting the full identifier appears.
