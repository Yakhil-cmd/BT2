# Q5738: verify_blob_kzg_proof - in-domain challenge shortcut in verification via Python [a-blob-crafted-so-the-evaluation-challen]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a blob crafted so the evaluation challenge equals a root of unity, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob crafted so the evaluation challenge equals a root of unity. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose challenge is a domain root so evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form takes the shortcut, and probe for a y mismatch (a blob crafted so the evaluation challenge equals a root of unity).
- Invariant to test: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain (input: a blob crafted so the evaluation challenge equals a root of unity).
