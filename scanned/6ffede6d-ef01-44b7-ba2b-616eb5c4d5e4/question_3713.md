# Q3713: message-export route confusion via encointer pallet xcm send on Encointer XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send` on Encointer XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
