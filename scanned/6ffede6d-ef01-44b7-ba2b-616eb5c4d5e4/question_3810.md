# Q3810: remote-payout beneficiary split via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer so that `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote` lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to high - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::from_on_remote`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer
- Exploit idea: lets a caller observe a success state locally while the remote transfer can still be replayed, fail open, or strand value
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
