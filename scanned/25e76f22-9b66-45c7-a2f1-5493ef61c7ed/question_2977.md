# Q2977: get-position via liquidate: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `collateral-receiver`, drive `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) — which returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, then read `get-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
