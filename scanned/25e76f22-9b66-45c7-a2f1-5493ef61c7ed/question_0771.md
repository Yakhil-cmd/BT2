# Q0771: next-index via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-index` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
