# Q1193: alias collision on execution via polkadotxcm limited reserve transfer on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `LocationToAccountId` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocationToAccountId`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
