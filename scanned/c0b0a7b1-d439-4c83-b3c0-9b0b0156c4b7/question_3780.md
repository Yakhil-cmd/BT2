# Q3780: fee-asset settlement mismatch via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways so that `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted, and leading to high - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: fee assets and transferred assets must reconcile exactly with the remote message that is emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
