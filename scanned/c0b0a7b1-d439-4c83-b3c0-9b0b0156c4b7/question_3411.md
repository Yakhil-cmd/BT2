# Q3411: burn-accounting drift via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Kusama runtime and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
