# Q2754: identity refund double-count via proxy proxy utility batch on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Polkadot identity config and control locations or treasury-routing state that receive slashed identity deposits so that `IdentityAdminOrigin` lets a user reclaim or avoid an identity-related deposit after the chain has already treated it as consumed, breaking the invariant that encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly, and leading to high - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityAdminOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: locations or treasury-routing state that receive slashed identity deposits
- Exploit idea: lets a user reclaim or avoid an identity-related deposit after the chain has already treated it as consumed
- Invariant to test: encoded identity fields must not let a signed user reach unauthorized privileged outcomes indirectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing
- Fast validation: targeted test proving whether treasury routing resolves to the expected account after adversarial input
