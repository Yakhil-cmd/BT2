# Q3039: username-expiry accounting drift via proxy proxy utility batch on People Kusama identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Kusama identity config and control username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls so that `IdentityAdminOrigin` creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated, breaking the invariant that identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once, and leading to high - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityAdminOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: username expiration and grace-period boundaries combined with balance-moving calls
- Exploit idea: creates a sequencing edge where identity cleanup and concurrent value transfer leave funds permanently stranded or duplicated
- Invariant to test: identity-related deposits must be debited, refunded, or slashed exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test for repeated identity mutation with balance assertions before and after refund/slash
