# Q4788: interest-rate via repay: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `repay` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
