# Q0003: total-assets via transfer: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `transfer` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets` touches, run `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
