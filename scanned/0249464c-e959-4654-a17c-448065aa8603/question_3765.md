# Q3765: query-state replay on payout via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout help

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways so that `TransferOverXcm::transfer` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::transfer`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset location, beneficiary conversion, and payment-status replay
