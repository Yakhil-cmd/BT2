# Q4140: remove-user-collateral via repay: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `repay` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
