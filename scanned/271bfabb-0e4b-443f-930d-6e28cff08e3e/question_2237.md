# Q2237: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - cells+proofs differ across precompute via C [a-blob-whose-first-coefficient-is-r-1-an]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the reference cell-proofs for the blob regardless of precompute so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compute cells and proofs with precompute 0 vs 8 and require identical bytes (a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the reference cell-proofs for the blob regardless of precompute.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: proof bytes == the reference cell-proofs for the blob regardless of precompute (input: a blob whose first coefficient is r-1 and the rest zero).
