# Q3028: interpolate-rate via collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
