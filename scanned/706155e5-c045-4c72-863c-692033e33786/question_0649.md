# Q649: beneficiary resolution split via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `FeeManager / Aliasers` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
