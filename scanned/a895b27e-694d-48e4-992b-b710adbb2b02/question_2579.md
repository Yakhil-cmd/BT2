# Q2579: verify_blob_kzg_proof - verify accepts compute output via Elixir [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify(compute(blob)) == true for every blob so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_blob_kzg_proof accepts the proof compute_blob_kzg_proof made for the same blob (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: verify(compute(blob)) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: verify(compute(blob)) == true for every blob (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
