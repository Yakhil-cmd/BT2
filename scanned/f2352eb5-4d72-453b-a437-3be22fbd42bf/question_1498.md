# Q1498: reserve-backed asset confusion via polkadotxcm send execute transfer on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{send, execute, transfer_assets, limited_reserve_transfer_assets}`
- Attacker controls: liquidity ratios, exact-in/exact-out swap parameters, and fee-paying asset selection
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
