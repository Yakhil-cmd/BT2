# Q4772: get-cached-indexes via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `get-cached-indexes` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
