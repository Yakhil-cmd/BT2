# Q289: rpc-state via getKeys 289

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the service command response correlation in `getKeys` (packages/gui/src/electron/api/getKeys.ts) control subscription event for a different wallet/fingerprint after a network switch and drive the sequence download or render content -> trigger linked wallet action so the GUI would transform attacker-controlled keys into privileged fields, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/gui/src/electron/api/getKeys.ts` / `getKeys`
- Entrypoint: service command response correlation
- Attacker controls: subscription event for a different wallet/fingerprint; after a network switch
- Exploit idea: transform attacker-controlled keys into privileged fields
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: fuzz canonicalization inputs and assert display, validation, and payload use the same canonical value
