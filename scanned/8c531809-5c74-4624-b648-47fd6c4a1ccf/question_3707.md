# Q3707: plaintext fallback for token storage - CredentialPatternFromHost in client.go

## Question
Does `CredentialPatternFromHost` in [git/client.go](git/client.go#L134) silently fall back from the OS keyring to a plaintext config file when an attacker-triggerable error occurs?

## Target
- File/function: [git/client.go:134](git/client.go#L134) - `CredentialPatternFromHost`
- Entrypoint: gh repo clone
- Attacker controls: a repository, branch, tag, PR head ref, remote, or .gitmodules entry the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Cause the keyring path to fail during an attacker-initiated flow, leaving the token on disk.
- Invariant to test: Storage downgrade is explicit, user-visible, and file-permission protected.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Exfiltration of the victim's GitHub OAuth token / git credentials to an attacker-controlled host (sensitive credential disclosure)
- Fast validation: Test injecting a keyring error and asserting either failure or a 0600 file plus a warning.
