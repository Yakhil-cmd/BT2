# Q0052: synthesize_pox_2_or_3_event_info: reward set weight exceeds locked STX

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `synthesize_pox_2_or_3_event_info` (in `pox-locking/src/events_24.rs`) via a pox-5 `contract-call?` (stake / register-for-bond / unstake / unstake-sbtc / stake-update / claim-rewards) or a burnchain stacking op the attacker crafts, such that `make_reward_set`/`get_threshold_from_participation` counts an unlocked staker, breaking the invariant that weight assigned for a cycle == STX locked and unexpired for it — leading to inflated signing weight?

## Target
- File/function: `pox-locking/src/events_24.rs` -> `synthesize_pox_2_or_3_event_info`
- Entrypoint: a pox-5 `contract-call?` (stake / register-for-bond / unstake / unstake-sbtc / stake-update / claim-rewards) or a burnchain stacking op the attacker crafts
- Attacker controls: every call argument, the attacker-deployed signer-manager contract, the L1 Bitcoin lockup proof, the sBTC amount, and the ordering of their own transactions
- Exploit idea: `make_reward_set`/`get_threshold_from_participation` counts an unlocked staker
- Invariant to test: weight assigned for a cycle == STX locked and unexpired for it
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - inflated signing weight
- Fast validation: test a stale participation total
