# Q3878: resolve-ststx via collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) varied, and assert that the value `resolve-ststx` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
