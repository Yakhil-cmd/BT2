# Q545: beneficiary resolution split via xcmpallet send on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
