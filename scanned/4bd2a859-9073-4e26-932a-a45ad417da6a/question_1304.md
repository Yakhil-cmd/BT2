# Q1304: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - cell-index stride into roots_of_unity via C [cell-index-63-last-data-column]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with cell_index 63 (last data column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that every roots_of_unity index < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB+1 so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 63 (last data column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: probe missing_cell_indices[i]*stride indexing into roots_of_unity for an out-of-range access (cell_index 63 (last data column)).
- Invariant to test: every roots_of_unity index < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB+1.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: every roots_of_unity index < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_EXT_BLOB+1 (input: cell_index 63 (last data column)).
