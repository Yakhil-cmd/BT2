# Q1889: digest bound to the wrong bytes - verifyRun in verify.go

## Question
Does `verifyRun` in [pkg/cmd/release/verify/verify.go](pkg/cmd/release/verify/verify.go#L118) compute or compare the artifact digest over data other than the exact bytes the user will run (for example a re-downloaded copy, a decompressed stream, or a manifest field)?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/release/verify/verify.go:118](pkg/cmd/release/verify/verify.go#L118) - `verifyRun`
- Entrypoint: gh release verify
- Attacker controls: an artifact, its Sigstore bundle, and the attacker's own repo/workflow claims
- Exploit idea: Serve one artifact for verification and a different one for the actual download.
- Invariant to test: The verified digest is computed over the same bytes that are written to disk and returned to the caller.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Supply-chain verification bypass: unsigned or wrongly attributed artifact reported as verified
- Fast validation: Test where the byte stream differs between verify and write, asserting a failure.
