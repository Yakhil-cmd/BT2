# Q3751: rpc-state via addVCProofs 3751

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the daemon RPC response handling in `addVCProofs` (packages/api/src/wallets/VC.ts) control out-of-order event and query responses after a network switch and drive the sequence download or render content -> trigger linked wallet action so the GUI would poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/wallets/VC.ts` / `addVCProofs`
- Entrypoint: daemon RPC response handling
- Attacker controls: out-of-order event and query responses; after a network switch
- Exploit idea: poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: mock remote fetch responses before and after preview and assert the submit path revalidates identity-critical fields
