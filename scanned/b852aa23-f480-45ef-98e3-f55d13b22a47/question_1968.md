# Q1968: calc-index-next via collateral-remove-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
