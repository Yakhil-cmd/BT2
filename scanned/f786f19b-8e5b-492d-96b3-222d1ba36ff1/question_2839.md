# Q2839: send-underlying via accrue: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `accrue` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, then read `send-underlying` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
