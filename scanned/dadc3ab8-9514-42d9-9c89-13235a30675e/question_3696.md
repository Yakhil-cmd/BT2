# Q3696: beneficiary resolution split via encointer pallet xcm send on Encointer XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send` on Encointer XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
