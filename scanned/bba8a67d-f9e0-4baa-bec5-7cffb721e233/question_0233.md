# Q0233: total-assets-preview via deposit: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, drive `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) — which re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `deposit` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
