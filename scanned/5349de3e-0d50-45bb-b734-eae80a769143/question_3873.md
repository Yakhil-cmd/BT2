# Q3873: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - cells+proofs match the reference via C [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that (cells,proofs) bytes == the reference output for every blob so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: differentially compare against Rust-Eth-KZG for random blobs (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: (cells,proofs) bytes == the reference output for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: (cells,proofs) bytes == the reference output for every blob (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
