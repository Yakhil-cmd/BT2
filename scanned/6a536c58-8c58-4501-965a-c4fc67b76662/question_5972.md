# Q5972: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - non-canonical cell field element via C [2-256-r-wraps-to-a-small-residue-if-redu]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with 2^256 - r (wraps to a small residue if reduced without the check), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: 2^256 - r (wraps to a small residue if reduced without the check). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in a cell; note the challenge hashes raw bytes before bytes_to_bls_field validates them (2^256 - r (wraps to a small residue if reduced without the check)).
- Invariant to test: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true (input: 2^256 - r (wraps to a small residue if reduced without the check)).
