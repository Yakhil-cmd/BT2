# Q3440: safe-call filter mismatch via coretimekusama pallet xcm execute on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimeKusama::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
