# Q2333: bridge-fee swap drift via snowbridgesystemfrontend signed bridge path on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot on Snowbridge runtime path and control token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config` makes the inbound converter create or reference the wrong foreign asset for a valid bridge payload, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config`
- Entrypoint: `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot
- Attacker controls: token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow
- Exploit idea: makes the inbound converter create or reference the wrong foreign asset for a valid bridge payload
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator plus bridge-queue test proving whether reorder or replay can break one-settlement invariants
