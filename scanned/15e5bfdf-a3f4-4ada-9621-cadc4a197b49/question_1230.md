# Q1230: set_len can be driven into unbounded work (vm_slice.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `set_len` in `transaction-context/src/vm_slice.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and make `set_len` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `set_len` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/vm_slice.rs` -> `set_len()` (around line 50)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `set_len` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `set_len` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `set_len` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
