# Q5393: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via accrue: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) — which reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `accrue` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
