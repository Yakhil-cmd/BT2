# Q0462: accrue-user-debts via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-debts` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
