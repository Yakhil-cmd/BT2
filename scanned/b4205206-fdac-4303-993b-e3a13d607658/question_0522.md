# Q0522: get-bitmap via borrow: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `borrow` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `get-bitmap` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
