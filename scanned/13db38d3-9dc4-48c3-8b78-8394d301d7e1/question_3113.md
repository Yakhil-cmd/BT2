# Q3113: calc-liq-debt-repay-real via liquidate-multi: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733) — which re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)` — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay-real`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
