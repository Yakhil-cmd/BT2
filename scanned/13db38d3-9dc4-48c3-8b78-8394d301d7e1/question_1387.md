# Q1387: process-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `process-debt-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
