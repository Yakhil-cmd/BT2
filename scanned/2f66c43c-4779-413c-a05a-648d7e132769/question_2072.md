# Q2072: interpolate-rate via liquidate: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `interpolate-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
