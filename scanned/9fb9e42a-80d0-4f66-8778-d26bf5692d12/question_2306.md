# Q2306: find-collateral-amount via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `find-collateral-amount` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
