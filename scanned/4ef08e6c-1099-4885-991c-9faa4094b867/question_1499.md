# Q1499: proxy-batched asset escape via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::{remote_proxy, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof}`
- Attacker controls: XCM messages that mix reserve-backed assets, foreign assets, and local trust-backed assets
- Exploit idea: creates a sequence where funds leave one subsystem but never become claimable in the destination subsystem
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
