# Q3801: mempool stale checked tx under amount boundary atomicity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through RPC CheckTx or InsertTx followed by commit and proposal by controlling same-sender txs, sequence, fees, balances and bridge/conversion messages when the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid, then keep stale checked txs after account state changes and execute invalid fund movement so that only txs valid against current committed state can enter blocks fails and no partial native, EVM, IBC, or token state can commit on an error path, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: app/mempool/manager.go::RecheckTxs
- Entrypoint: RPC CheckTx or InsertTx followed by commit and proposal
- Attacker controls: same-sender txs, sequence, fees, balances and bridge/conversion messages; scenario focus: amount boundary plus atomicity.
- Exploit idea: keep stale checked txs after account state changes and execute invalid fund movement while the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid.
- Invariant to test: only txs valid against current committed state can enter blocks; also verify no partial native, EVM, IBC, or token state can commit on an error path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: build a local integration test with two accounts and compare state root plus balances before and after the attempted flow.
