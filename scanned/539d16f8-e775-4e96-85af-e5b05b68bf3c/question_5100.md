# Q5100: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - duplicate (commitment,cell_index) accepted via Rust [cell-index-128-cells-per-ext-blob-one-pa]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok true iff every supplied cell lies on its commitment's polynomial; duplicate columns cannot average into acceptance so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit the same column index twice for one commitment with two different cells so their r-weighted sum interpolates while neither cell is valid (cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
- Invariant to test: *ok true iff every supplied cell lies on its commitment's polynomial; duplicate columns cannot average into acceptance.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: *ok true iff every supplied cell lies on its commitment's polynomial; duplicate columns cannot average into acceptance (input: cell_index 128 = CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB (one past the end)).
