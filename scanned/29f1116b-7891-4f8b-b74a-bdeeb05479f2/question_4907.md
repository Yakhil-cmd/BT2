# Q4907: verifyKzgProof - verify agrees with compute via Zig [a-value-that-is-canonical-little-endian]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyKzgProof via root.zig` with a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_kzg_proof(compute_kzg_proof(blob,z)) == true for every blob and z so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: verify_kzg_proof_impl)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyKzgProof via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_kzg_proof accepts exactly the (proof,y) that compute_kzg_proof produced for the same z (a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
- Invariant to test: verify_kzg_proof(compute_kzg_proof(blob,z)) == true for every blob and z.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: verify_kzg_proof(compute_kzg_proof(blob,z)) == true for every blob and z (input: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
