# Q2199: bridge-message reorder via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue_v2::Config` makes the inbound converter create or reference the wrong foreign asset for a valid bridge payload, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue_v2::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: makes the inbound converter create or reference the wrong foreign asset for a valid bridge payload
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
