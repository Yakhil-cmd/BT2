# Q5516: find-debt-scaled via collateral-remove-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `find-debt-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
