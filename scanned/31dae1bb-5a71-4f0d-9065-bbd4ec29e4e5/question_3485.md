# Q3485: oracle-last-update via liquidate-multi: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) — which returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
