# Q0670: resolve-ststx via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it? `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
