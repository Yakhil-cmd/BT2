# Q5631: interpolate-rate via collateral-remove: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interpolate-rate` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
