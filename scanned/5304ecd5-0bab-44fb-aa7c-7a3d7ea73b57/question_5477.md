# Q5477: computeCellsAndKzgProofs - proof bit-reversal ordering via Zig [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.computeCellsAndKzgProofs via root.zig` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof k == the reference proof for cell k so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bit_reversal_permutation)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.computeCellsAndKzgProofs via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm bit_reversal_permutation on proofs matches cell ordering and the spec (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: proof k == the reference proof for cell k.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: proof k == the reference proof for cell k (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
