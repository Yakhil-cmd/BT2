# Q188: Substitute app or public key

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and swap `private channel` for attacker-chosen `shared channel` while keeping the rest of `participants`, `data`, `protocol message timing` valid enough that `do_broadcast` produces an accepted unauthorized output, causing Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::do_broadcast`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `participants`, `data`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Substitute application/public-key context late in the flow and check whether the output remains acceptable to downstream verifiers.
- Invariant to test: `private channel` outputs must be bound to the exact `shared channel` selected by the honest protocol run.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `private channel` data into `do_broadcast`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
