# Q5954: accrue-user-debts via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
