# Q3291: revenue-claim replay via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries so that `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `CoretimeAllocator::{request_core_count, request_revenue_info_at, assign_core}`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
