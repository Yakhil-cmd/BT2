# Q3330: verifyBlobKzgProof - in-domain challenge shortcut in verification via Nim [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.verifyBlobKzgProof (used by Nimbus)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.verifyBlobKzgProof (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose challenge is a domain root so evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form takes the shortcut, and probe for a y mismatch (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: the y verified == p(challenge) even when the challenge is in the evaluation domain (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
