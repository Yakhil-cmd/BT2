# Q619: beneficiary resolution split via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `SovereignAccountOf` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
