# Q1575: swap-settlement mismatch via foreignassets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_asset_conversion::Config`
- Entrypoint: `ForeignAssets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of native, foreign, or pooled assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
