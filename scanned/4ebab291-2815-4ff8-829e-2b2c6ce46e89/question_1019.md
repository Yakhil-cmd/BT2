# Q1019: proxy-batch privilege widening via proxy proxy multisig as on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Kusama Relay runtime and control nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
