# Q2330: token-registration mismatch via assetconversion create pool add on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2` replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match, breaking the invariant that Ethereum-facing locations and local beneficiaries must not collide or resolve inconsistently, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match
- Invariant to test: Ethereum-facing locations and local beneficiaries must not collide or resolve inconsistently
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
