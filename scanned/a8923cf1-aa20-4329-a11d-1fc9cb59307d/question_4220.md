# Q4220: refresh via repay: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `repay` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `refresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
