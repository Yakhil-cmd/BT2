# Q4226: accrue-user-debts via deposit: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `deposit` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
