# Q3263: iter-find-superset via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
`iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) short-circuits on the first superset match. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
