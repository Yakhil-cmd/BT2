# Q3713: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate-multi: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) — which re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
