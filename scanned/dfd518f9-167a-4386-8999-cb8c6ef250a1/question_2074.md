# Q2074: bridge-path availability wedge via assethubpolkadot signed bridge frontend on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` causes inbound, outbound, relayer-reward, and XCM routing state to disagree about which message or beneficiary was finalized, breaking the invariant that relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot signed bridge-frontend path that lands on BridgeHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: causes inbound, outbound, relayer-reward, and XCM routing state to disagree about which message or beneficiary was finalized
- Invariant to test: relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over message ordering, beneficiary choice, and queue state with one-settlement assertions
