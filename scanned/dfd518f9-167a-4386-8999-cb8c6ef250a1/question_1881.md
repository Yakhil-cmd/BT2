# Q1881: fee-asset undercharge path via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
