# Q1116: query or topic reuse via polkadotxcm execute on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape so that `Barrier` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
