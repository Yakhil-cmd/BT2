# Q3607: reputation-consumption replay via runtimecall encointertreasuries signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control community ids, ceremony indices, meetup references, and participant-controlled reputation artifacts so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated, breaking the invariant that each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context, and leading to critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path
- Attacker controls: community ids, ceremony indices, meetup references, and participant-controlled reputation artifacts
- Exploit idea: lets a signed user cross community or ceremony boundaries that the runtime expected to remain isolated
- Invariant to test: each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
