# Q1172: find-collateral-amount via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order varied, and assert that the value `find-collateral-amount` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
