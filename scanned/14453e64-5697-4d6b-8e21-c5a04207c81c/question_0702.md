# Q0702: status via collateral-remove: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `status` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
