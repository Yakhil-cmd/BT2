# Q3477: query or topic reuse via signed user flow that on Coretime Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM` on Coretime Kusama XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow that reaches Coretime Kusama through valid upstream XCM`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
