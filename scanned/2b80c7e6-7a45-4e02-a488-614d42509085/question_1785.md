# Q1785: accrue-and-cache via redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling `amount` of shares burned, drive `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) — which keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-and-cache` touches, run `redeem` with `amount` of shares burned, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
