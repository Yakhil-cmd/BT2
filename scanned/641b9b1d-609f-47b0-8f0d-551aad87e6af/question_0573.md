# Q573: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet limited reserve transfer on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `TrustedTeleporters` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedTeleporters`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
