# Q0685: digest bound to the wrong bytes - downloadCopilot in copilot.go

## Question
Does `downloadCopilot` in [pkg/cmd/copilot/copilot.go](pkg/cmd/copilot/copilot.go#L239) compute or compare the artifact digest over data other than the exact bytes the user will run (for example a re-downloaded copy, a decompressed stream, or a manifest field)?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/cmd/copilot/copilot.go:239](pkg/cmd/copilot/copilot.go#L239) - `downloadCopilot`
- Entrypoint: gh copilot copilot
- Attacker controls: an imported alias file, agent session input, release-notes text, or repo coordinates the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Serve one artifact for verification and a different one for the actual download.
- Invariant to test: The verified digest is computed over the same bytes that are written to disk and returned to the caller.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Supply-chain verification bypass: unsigned or wrongly attributed artifact reported as verified
- Fast validation: Test where the byte stream differs between verify and write, asserting a failure.
