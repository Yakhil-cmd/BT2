# Q815: proxy-batch privilege widening via staking bond unbond rebond on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Staking::{bond, unbond, rebond, nominate, payout_stakers}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
