# Q5894: VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch - batch equals per-item single verify via Go [a-batch-mixing-a-valid-entry-with-one-wh]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch verdict == AND of verify_blob_kzg_proof over the same triples, for every n so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyBlobKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify each triple alone and as a batch and require identical verdicts (a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity).
- Invariant to test: batch verdict == AND of verify_blob_kzg_proof over the same triples, for every n.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: batch verdict == AND of verify_blob_kzg_proof over the same triples, for every n (input: a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity).
