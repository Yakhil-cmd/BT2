# Q899: cross-pallet hold mismatch via claims claim claim attest on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: XCM-triggered and local transitions must preserve the same accounting rules
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
