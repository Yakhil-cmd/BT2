# Q0036: synthesize_pox_2_or_3_event_info: reward claimed before its cycle settled

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `synthesize_pox_2_or_3_event_info` (in `pox-locking/src/events_24.rs`) via a pox-5 `contract-call?` (stake / register-for-bond / unstake / unstake-sbtc / stake-update / claim-rewards) or a burnchain stacking op the attacker crafts, such that a cycle is claimed before settlement finalises its per-token value, breaking the invariant that rewards claimable for a cycle == rewards settled for it — leading to premature/unbacked reward?

## Target
- File/function: `pox-locking/src/events_24.rs` -> `synthesize_pox_2_or_3_event_info`
- Entrypoint: a pox-5 `contract-call?` (stake / register-for-bond / unstake / unstake-sbtc / stake-update / claim-rewards) or a burnchain stacking op the attacker crafts
- Attacker controls: every call argument, the attacker-deployed signer-manager contract, the L1 Bitcoin lockup proof, the sBTC amount, and the ordering of their own transactions
- Exploit idea: a cycle is claimed before settlement finalises its per-token value
- Invariant to test: rewards claimable for a cycle == rewards settled for it
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - premature/unbacked reward
- Fast validation: test claiming an unsettled cycle
