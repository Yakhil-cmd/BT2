# Q5165: calc-cumulative-debt via accrue: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) — which multiplies scaled principal by an index — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `accrue` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
