# Q4348: total-supply-preview via supply-collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
