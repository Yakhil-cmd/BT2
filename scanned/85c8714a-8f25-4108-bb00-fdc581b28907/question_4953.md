# Q4953: interpolate-rate via call-ststx-ratio: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, drive `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) — which interpolates between packed u16 curve points — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interpolate-rate` touches, run `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
