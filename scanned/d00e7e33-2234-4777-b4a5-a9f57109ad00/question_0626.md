# Q626: message-export route confusion via xcmpallet limited reserve transfer on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `LocalOriginConverter` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `LocalOriginConverter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
