# Q800: double-withdraw edge via claims claim claim attest on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: nested XCM execution with attacker-chosen asset, beneficiary, and origin-shaping instructions
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
