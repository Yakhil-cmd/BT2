# Q3621: accrue-user-debts via call-ststx-ratio: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, drive `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) — which folds accrual over the position's debt list only — to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-debts` touches, run `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
