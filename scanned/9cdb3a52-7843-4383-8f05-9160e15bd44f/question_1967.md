# Q1967: process-debt-asset via liquidate: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `borrower`, any third-party principal, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
