# Q46: proxy-type widening via utility batch all register on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable, breaking the invariant that local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users, and leading to critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])`
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: admits a stale or mismatched proof after the remote authorization should no longer be usable
- Invariant to test: local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized dispatch as another account with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
