# Q3656: recoverCellsAndKzgProofs - duplicate in the bit-reversed missing list via Java [a-duplicated-index-pair-k-k-for-the-same]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the missing-index set == the true complement of the supplied columns so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: choose indices whose reverse_bits_limited missing set collides so vanishing_polynomial_for_missing_cells builds a wrong Z(x) (a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: the missing-index set == the true complement of the supplied columns.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: the missing-index set == the true complement of the supplied columns (input: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
