# Q0272: send-tokens via transfer: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `transfer` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
