# Q2515: calculate-asset-notional-value via liquidate-multi: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the full batch list and its ordering, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `calculate-asset-notional-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
