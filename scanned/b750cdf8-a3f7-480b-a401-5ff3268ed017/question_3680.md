# Q3680: Exechook.Do — webhook body oom under both hooks

## Question
Does Exechook.Do(): running the operator's command with cwd = the worktree path and `GITSYNC_HASH` appended to os.Environ() stay safe when an attacker makes the webhook endpoint stream an endless body in a deployment using both exec and web hooks — or can io.ReadAll grows without limit inside the sidecar, violating “webhook responses are size-capped” and producing OOM kill of the sidecar: denial of updates?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/hook/exechook.go](pkg/hook/exechook.go) — `Exechook.Do / envKV`
- Entrypoint: attacker push -> hook fired after (or before) publish with the new hash and worktree path
- Attacker controls: Makes the webhook endpoint stream an endless body. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: io.ReadAll grows without limit inside the sidecar
- Invariant to test: webhook responses are size-capped
- Expected Immunefi impact: OOM kill of the sidecar: denial of updates (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: publish rapidly and assert the hook observed every published revision, or that skipping is explicitly reported
