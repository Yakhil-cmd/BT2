# Q4482: Logger.Error — log volume dos under sync on signal

## Question
Under `--sync-on-signal` configured, an attacker drives high-verbosity logging (huge ref lists, fetch verbosity, hook output). In the error-file writer: tempfile creation in --root, JSON payload marshalling, and deletion on success, can that mean log volume fills the node's log partition, so that the invariant “log output is bounded per sync” no longer holds and the outcome is node-level disk exhaustion affecting other workloads?

## Target
- File/function: [pkg/logging/logging.go](pkg/logging/logging.go) — `Logger.Error / writeContent / ExportError / DeleteErrorFile`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Drives high-verbosity logging (huge ref lists, fetch verbosity, hook output). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: log volume fills the node's log partition
- Invariant to test: log output is bounded per sync
- Expected Immunefi impact: node-level disk exhaustion affecting other workloads (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: break the sync deterministically and assert `/` stops returning 200 (or that the staleness is otherwise surfaced)
