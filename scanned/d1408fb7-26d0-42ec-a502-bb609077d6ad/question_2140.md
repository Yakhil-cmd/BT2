# Q2140: mask-pos via repay: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal reach `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET, the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `repay` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
