# Q2843: recoverCellsAndKzgProofs - full-input branch copies unchecked cells via Java [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: provide all 128 cells (num_cells==CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB) so recovery copies them verbatim, then recomputes proofs from them (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: even on the copy branch, recovered cells lie on a degree<4096 poly and proofs match it (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
