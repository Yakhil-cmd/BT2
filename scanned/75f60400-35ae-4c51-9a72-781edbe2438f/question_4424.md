# Q4424: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - cell batch equals per-cell checks via Zig [a-batch-whose-proofs-are-permuted-relati]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig` with a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch verdict == AND of the per-cell single-tuple verdicts so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify each cell tuple alone (n=1) and batched and require identical verdicts (a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
- Invariant to test: batch verdict == AND of the per-cell single-tuple verdicts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: batch verdict == AND of the per-cell single-tuple verdicts (input: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
