# Q2346: unpack-u16 via deposit: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `deposit` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `recipient`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
