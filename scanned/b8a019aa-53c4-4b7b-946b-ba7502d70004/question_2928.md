# Q2928: parse_permissioned_burn_instruction behaves inconsistently at a feature/epoch boundary (permissioned_burn.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `parse_permissioned_burn_instruction` in `transaction-status/src/parse_token/extension/permissioned_burn.rs` with an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently, and have `parse_permissioned_burn_instruction` evaluated under one rule during banking and a different one during replay, so that the invariant "A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-status/src/parse_token/extension/permissioned_burn.rs` -> `parse_permissioned_burn_instruction()` (around line 15)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently
- Exploit idea: Land the transaction exactly on the slot where the gate flips so `parse_permissioned_burn_instruction` is evaluated under one rule during scheduling and another during replay.
- Invariant to test: A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Replay the same transaction against banks on both sides of the boundary and assert both nodes agree on accept/reject and result.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
