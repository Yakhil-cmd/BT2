# Q3134: BlobToKzgCommitment - identity-point encoding of a commitment via CSharp [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.BlobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the 48 output bytes == the spec's compressed identity encoding, matching other clients so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: blob_to_kzg_commitment (helper: bytes_from_g1)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.BlobToKzgCommitment via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: craft a blob whose commitment is the identity and confirm bytes_from_g1 serializes it exactly as the spec expects (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: the 48 output bytes == the spec's compressed identity encoding, matching other clients.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: the 48 output bytes == the spec's compressed identity encoding, matching other clients (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
