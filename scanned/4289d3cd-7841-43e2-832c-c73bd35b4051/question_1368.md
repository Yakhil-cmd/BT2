# Q1368: convert-to-shares-preview via deposit: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call reach `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `deposit` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `convert-to-shares-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
