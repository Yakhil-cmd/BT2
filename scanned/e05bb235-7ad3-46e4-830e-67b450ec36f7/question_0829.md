# Q829: reward-accounting drift via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
