# Q1013: reward-accounting drift via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: converts a user-controlled call into a more privileged or differently metered runtime path
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
