# Q943: Mix ciphersuite domains

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and exploit `recv` so `shared channel` derived for one ciphersuite, proof role, or transcript label is accepted in another domain, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::recv`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `header`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Create a domain or ciphersuite mix where `shared channel` material from one role verifies in another.
- Invariant to test: Ciphersuite-specific `shared channel` derivations must not collide across domains or protocol roles.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `shared channel` data into `recv`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
