# Q4109: find-collateral-amount via collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
