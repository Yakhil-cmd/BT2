# Q2422: vault-accrue via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
