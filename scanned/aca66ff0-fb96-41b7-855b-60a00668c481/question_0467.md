# Q0467: collateral-remove via supply-collateral-add: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
