# Q3090: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs - identity encoding of a cell proof via C [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_g1)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check a proof that is the identity is compressed exactly as the spec (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: proof bytes == the spec compressed identity, matching other clients (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
