# Q3244: is-healthy-with-mask via liquidate-multi: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch reach `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
