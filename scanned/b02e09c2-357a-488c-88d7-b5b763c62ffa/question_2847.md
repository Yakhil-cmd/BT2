# Q2847: relayer timeout refund under same-block reorder sender consistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through EVM call to relayer timeout(bytes) by controlling MsgTimeout bytes, proof, packet sender, sequence and denom when two attacker-controlled transactions are valid separately but reordered in one block, then claim timeout refund for another sender or a completed packet so that timeout refunds only the original sender once for an actually timed-out packet fails and Cosmos address bytes, EVM addresses, tx signers, and event senders name the same principal, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: x/cronos/keeper/precompiles/relayer.go::Run Timeout
- Entrypoint: EVM call to relayer timeout(bytes)
- Attacker controls: MsgTimeout bytes, proof, packet sender, sequence and denom; scenario focus: same-block reorder plus sender consistency.
- Exploit idea: claim timeout refund for another sender or a completed packet while two attacker-controlled transactions are valid separately but reordered in one block.
- Invariant to test: timeout refunds only the original sender once for an actually timed-out packet; also verify Cosmos address bytes, EVM addresses, tx signers, and event senders name the same principal.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: fuzz the controlled fields while asserting the invariant and rejecting any profitable state delta. Scoped to live HackenProof Cronos Blockchain Protocols: cryptographic flaws and vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds; excludes DoS/DDoS/spam, gas draining, leaked keys, privileged-address/admin abuse, basic governance attacks, known fork/dependency issues without a working Cronos PoC, tests, mocks, scripts, docs, disabled configs, and non-production code.
