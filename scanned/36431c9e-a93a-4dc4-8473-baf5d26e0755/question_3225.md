# Q3225: refresh via borrow: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, drive `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) — which rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `borrow` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `refresh` touches, run `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
