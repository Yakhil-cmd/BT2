# Q1262: Mismatch commitment and share

## Question
Can a single malicious participant or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign(...)`, `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::sign(...)`, or the triple-generation pipeline` and pair a valid-looking `alpha share` with a different `correlated` reveal so `correlated_ot_receiver` checks each piece in isolation but never the combined statement, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/ecdsa/ot_based_ecdsa/triples/correlated_ot_extension.rs::correlated_ot_receiver`
- Entrypoint: `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign(...)`, `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::sign(...)`, or the triple-generation pipeline`
- Attacker controls: `params`, `k0`, `k1`, `x`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Commit to one `alpha share` and reveal another `correlated` that still satisfies separate local checks.
- Invariant to test: A commitment and its corresponding `alpha share` reveal must be validated as the same statement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign(...)`, `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::sign(...)`, or the triple-generation pipeline`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `alpha share` data into `correlated_ot_receiver`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
