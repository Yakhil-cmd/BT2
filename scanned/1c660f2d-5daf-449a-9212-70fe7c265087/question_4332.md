# Q4332: calc-liq-factor via liquidate-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `calc-liq-factor` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703` -> `calc-liq-factor`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
