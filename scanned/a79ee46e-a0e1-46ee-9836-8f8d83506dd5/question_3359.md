# Q3359: unknown-organization error path -> advance a victim merge queue

## Question
Chaining the `unknown-organization error path` verification gap (attacker targets `Shipit::GithubOrganizationUnknown` handling so a rescued error still leaves the request in a state the handler acts on) with a `status` handler, can an unprivileged attacker advance a victim merge queue on a repository they do not own?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `status` body plus signature/headers; targets `Shipit::GithubOrganizationUnknown` handling so a rescued error still leaves the request in a state the handler acts on
- Exploit idea: the `head(422)` on an unknown org actually halts the filter chain before `create` runs, and the accepted `status` event lets the attacker advance a victim merge queue
- Invariant to test: A forged webhook cannot cause any state change attributed to a repository/org whose secret did not verify it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Unauthorized deploy/rollback/merge of attacker-controlled code
- Fast validation: minitest: forge the `status` event under the `unknown-organization error path` condition, assert the downstream mutation for the victim occurred.
