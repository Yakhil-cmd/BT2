# Q2072: scheduling_budget arithmetic overflows on reachable values (scheduler_controller.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `scheduling_budget` in `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/scheduler_controller.rs` with a request that stays one unit under the limit but repeats within a single transaction, and make the arithmetic in `scheduling_budget` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/scheduler_controller.rs` -> `scheduling_budget()` (around line 512)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a request that stays one unit under the limit but repeats within a single transaction
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `scheduling_budget` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `scheduling_budget` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
