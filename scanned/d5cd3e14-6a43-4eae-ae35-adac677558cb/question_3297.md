# Q3297: proxy-batched broker escape via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries so that `BurnCoretimeRevenue` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `BurnCoretimeRevenue`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: signed Broker operations around purchase, renewal, pooling, transfer, or sale boundaries
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: coretime revenue and burn accounting must never drift from actual user-visible balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
