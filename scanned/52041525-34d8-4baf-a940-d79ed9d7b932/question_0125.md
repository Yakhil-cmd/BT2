# Q125: proof-stack confusion via utility batch all register on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary so that `BlockToRoot / RemoteProxyContext` causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `BlockToRoot / RemoteProxyContext`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])`
- Attacker controls: a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary
- Exploit idea: causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
