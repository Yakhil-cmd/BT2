# Q1566: approval or proof replay via ahops unreserve lease deposit on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}`
- Attacker controls: unlock, unbond, or claim timing around pool, staking, and migrated balances
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: no user-controlled asset path may create unbacked issuance or release more value than it debits
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over asset kind, fee asset, approval, and pool-state permutations
