# Q3478: receive-underlying via accrue: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `accrue` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
