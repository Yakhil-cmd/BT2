# Q5607: computeCells - FK20 circulant stride mapping via Zig [a-blob-with-a-single-nonzero-coefficient]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.computeCells via root.zig` with a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cells derived from x_ext_fft_columns == the reference cells so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: circulant_coeffs_stride)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.computeCells via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm circulant_coeffs_stride maps blob coefficients into the 2r circulant vector as the paper/spec dictates (a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
- Invariant to test: cells derived from x_ext_fft_columns == the reference cells.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: cells derived from x_ext_fft_columns == the reference cells (input: a blob with a single nonzero coefficient at index 4095).
