# Q4475: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - strict-ascending index check via Elixir [an-ascending-list-with-one-column-index]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with an ascending list with one column index repeated later, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an ascending list with one column index repeated later. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit indices that are not strictly ascending and confirm the C_KZG_BADARGS guard fires before any write (an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
- Invariant to test: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr (input: an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
