# Q3176: revenue-claim replay via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot runtime and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: turns a normal broker action into a more privileged or differently metered transition through proxy, batch, or XCM composition
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
