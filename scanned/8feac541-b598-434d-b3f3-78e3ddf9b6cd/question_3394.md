# Q3394: proxy-batched broker escape via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Kusama runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test around purchase, renewal, burn, and revenue-claim ordering
