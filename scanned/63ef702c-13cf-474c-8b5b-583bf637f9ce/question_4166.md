# Q4166: verify_blob_kzg_proof - non-canonical blob element in verify via C [the-field-element-0-as-32-zero-bytes]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: blob_to_polynomial)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in the blob and confirm blob_to_polynomial rejects before pairing (the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
- Invariant to test: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false (input: the field element 0 as 32 zero bytes).
