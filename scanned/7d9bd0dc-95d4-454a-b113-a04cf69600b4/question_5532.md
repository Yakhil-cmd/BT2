# Q5532: find via collateral-remove: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map, the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `find` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
