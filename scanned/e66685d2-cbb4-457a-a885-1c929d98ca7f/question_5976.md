# Q5976: get-bitmap via collateral-remove: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `get-bitmap` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
