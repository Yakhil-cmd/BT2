# Q2772: sub-account deposit leak via proxy proxy utility batch on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Polkadot identity config and control inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched so that `IdentityAdminOrigin` causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable, breaking the invariant that treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityAdminOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: inputs that maximize encoded field usage while the same account is proxied or batched
- Exploit idea: causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable
- Invariant to test: treasury routing for slashed deposits must never be attacker-controlled from a signed path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of deposits or balances tied to identity lifecycle
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
