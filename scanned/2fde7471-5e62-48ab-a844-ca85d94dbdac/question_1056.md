# Q1056: query or topic reuse via polkadotxcm transfer assets on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::transfer_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `PoolAssetsExchanger` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `PoolAssetsExchanger`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
