# Q3857: query-state replay on payout via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions so that `TransferOverXcm::transfer` makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::transfer`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions
- Exploit idea: makes fee charging and remote settlement use different asset identities or amounts
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
