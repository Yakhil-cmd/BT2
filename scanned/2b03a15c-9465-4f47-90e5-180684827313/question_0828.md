# Q0828: construct_instructions_account arithmetic overflows on reachable values (account_loader.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `construct_instructions_account` in `svm/src/account_loader.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and make the arithmetic in `construct_instructions_account` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/account_loader.rs` -> `construct_instructions_account()` (around line 654)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `construct_instructions_account` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `construct_instructions_account` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
