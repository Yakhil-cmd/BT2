# Q1714: write_packed_storages can strand user funds permanently (ancient_append_vecs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `write_packed_storages` in `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and drive the target account into a state that no later instruction will accept, so that the invariant "Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` -> `write_packed_storages()` (around line 646)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Drive an account through `write_packed_storages` into a state no subsequent instruction accepts, so the owner can never withdraw.
- Invariant to test: Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Exhaustive state-machine test over `write_packed_storages`'s transitions; assert every reachable state has a path back to a withdrawable state.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can permanently lock a victim's stake, vote, or nonce account by driving it into a state no instruction can exit, or by breaking rent-exempt or account-size invariants.
