# Q1040: unlock-ordering mismatch via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
