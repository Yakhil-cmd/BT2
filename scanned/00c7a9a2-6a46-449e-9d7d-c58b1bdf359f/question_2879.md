# Q2879: resolve-or-create via collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
`resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
