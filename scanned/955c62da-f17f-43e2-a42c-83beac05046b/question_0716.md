# Q716: message-export route confusion via xcmpallet teleport assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `XcmRouter` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmRouter`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
