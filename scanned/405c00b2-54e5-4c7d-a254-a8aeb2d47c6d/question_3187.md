# Q3187: computeCells - field-element encoding inside cells via Nim [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.computeCells (used by Nimbus)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation so that honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: bytes_from_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.computeCells (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm each 32-byte lane in a cell is the canonical big-endian encoding of the data point (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - honest nodes compute different commitment/proof/cell bytes for one blob, breaking data-availability-sampling agreement.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: cell lane bytes == canonical encode of the extended-blob evaluation (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
