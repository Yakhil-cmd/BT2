# Q687: safe-call filter mismatch via xcmpallet teleport assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `FeeManager / Aliasers` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
