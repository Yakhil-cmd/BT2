# Q2881: slash-routing confusion via identity set identity clear on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Kusama runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to high - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized execution against another account or beneficiary
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or proxy test if the path depends on aliased locations or nested execution
