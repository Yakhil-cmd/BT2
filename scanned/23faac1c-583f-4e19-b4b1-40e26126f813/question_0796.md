# Q796: claim-path state divergence via crowdloan contribute withdraw on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Crowdloan::{contribute, withdraw}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: user-controlled batching must not bypass staking, pool, claim, or proxy restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
