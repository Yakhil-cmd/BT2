# Q5479: unpack-u16 via liquidate-multi: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `unpack-u16` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
