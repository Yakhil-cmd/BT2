# Q5185: repoSync.fetch — packfile resource bomb under first sync

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who pushes a pack whose delta chains and object count explode on the client (deep delta, many tiny objects), under the very first sync after container start, when the root is empty and syncCount is 0, reach a state where — in the argv assembled in fetch() (`fetch <repo> <ref> --verbose --no-progress --prune --no-auto-gc` plus --depth/--unshallow/--filter) — fetch consumes CPU and memory beyond --sync-timeout, and the timeout kill leaves partial state behind, breaking the invariant that fetch cost is bounded and a timeout leaves the repo in a recoverable state and yielding sidecar resource exhaustion plus repo corruption requiring a full wipe?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.fetch`
- Entrypoint: attacker push to the synced repo -> next `git fetch` in the periodic sync loop
- Attacker controls: Pushes a pack whose delta chains and object count explode on the client (deep delta, many tiny objects). Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: fetch consumes CPU and memory beyond --sync-timeout, and the timeout kill leaves partial state behind
- Invariant to test: fetch cost is bounded and a timeout leaves the repo in a recoverable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: sidecar resource exhaustion plus repo corruption requiring a full wipe (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: unit-test the resolution path with a fixture repo and assert the resolved hash equals `git rev-parse <ref>` on the server
