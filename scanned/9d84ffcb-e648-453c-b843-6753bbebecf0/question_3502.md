# Q3502: cross-ceremony state bleed via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around Encointer calls on Encointer runtime and control XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state, breaking the invariant that each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around Encointer calls
- Attacker controls: XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state
- Invariant to test: each reputation, meetup result, offline payment, or treasury claim must be consumable exactly once and only in its own context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
