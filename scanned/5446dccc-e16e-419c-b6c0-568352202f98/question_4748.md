# Q4748: accrue-user-debts via accrue: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `accrue` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
