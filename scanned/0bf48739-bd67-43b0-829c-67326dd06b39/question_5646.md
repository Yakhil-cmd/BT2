# Q5646: get-position via supply-collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `get-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
