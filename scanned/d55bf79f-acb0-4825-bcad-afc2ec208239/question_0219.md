# Q219: treasury-transfer boundary via ahops unreserve crowdloan reserve on Asset Hub operations pallet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve` on Asset Hub operations pallet and control the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow so that `Pallet::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve` makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping, breaking the invariant that partial failures must not leave the user paid while the reserve, hold, or pot accounting still claims the value exists, and leading to high - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/ah-ops/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::unreserve_crowdloan_reserve`
- Attacker controls: the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow
- Exploit idea: makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping
- Invariant to test: partial failures must not leave the user paid while the reserve, hold, or pot accounting still claims the value exists
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical accounting corruption across migration and contribution cleanup flows
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over block, depositor, and para_id combinations with one-shot-withdraw invariants
