# Q5940: send-tokens via liquidate: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `liquidate` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `send-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
