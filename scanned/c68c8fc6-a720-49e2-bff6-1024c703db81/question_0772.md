# Q772: claim-path state divergence via xcmpallet execute send limited on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to high - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::{execute, send, limited_reserve_transfer_assets, teleport_assets}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - network-wide halt or stuck critical queue
- Fast validation: invariant test that repeats the sequence until a double-claim or accounting drift appears
