# Q2542: asset-converter split-brain via collectivespolkadot pallet xcm execute on Collectives Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Collectives Polkadot XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CollectivesPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
