# Q2317: bridge-fee swap drift via snowbridgesystemfrontend signed bridge path on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2` routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class, breaking the invariant that front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `SnowbridgeExporter / SnowbridgeExporterV2`
- Entrypoint: `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class
- Invariant to test: front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
