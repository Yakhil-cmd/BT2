# Q2086: bridge-path availability wedge via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control relayer-beneficiary choices, bridge message ordering, and queue occupancy shaped by valid user bridge actions so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume, breaking the invariant that one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: relayer-beneficiary choices, bridge message ordering, and queue occupancy shaped by valid user bridge actions
- Exploit idea: reaches a bridge-related dispatch path with a different privilege, fee, or beneficiary context than the queue and reward code assume
- Invariant to test: one user-triggered bridge action must map to one committed message, one beneficiary, and one settlement result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over message ordering, beneficiary choice, and queue state with one-settlement assertions
