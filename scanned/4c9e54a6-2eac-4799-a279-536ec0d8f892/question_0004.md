# Q4: stale proof replay via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary so that `Pallet::do_remote_proxy` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::do_remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a `RelayChain` proof anchored near the storage-root retention boundary
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
