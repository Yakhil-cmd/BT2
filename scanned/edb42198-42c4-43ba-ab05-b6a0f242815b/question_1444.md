# Q1444: receive-underlying via deposit: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it pulls the underlying from a named account, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `deposit` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
