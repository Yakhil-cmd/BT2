# Q1148: message-export route confusion via polkadotxcm send on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::send` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `AssetTransactors` makes `HollarFromHydration`, reserve matching, and asset transacting disagree about whether the transferred asset is reserve-backed or locally spendable, breaking the invariant that asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `AssetTransactors`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::send`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: makes `HollarFromHydration`, reserve matching, and asset transacting disagree about whether the transferred asset is reserve-backed or locally spendable
- Invariant to test: asset backing must remain consistent across local balances, foreign assets, pool assets, reserve-backed assets, and bridged representations
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
