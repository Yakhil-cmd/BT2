# Q3753: message-export route confusion via encointer pallet xcm send on Encointer XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send` on Encointer XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Encointer::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
