# Q103: account-mapping collision via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::register_remote_proxy_proof` causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::register_remote_proxy_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: fuzz test over account mapping and proxy-definition conversion with privilege-equality assertions
