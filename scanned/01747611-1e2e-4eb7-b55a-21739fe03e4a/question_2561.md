# Q2561: Validate same bytes under two meanings

## Question
Can a malicious participant below threshold enter through `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and submit the same raw `statement encoding` bytes under two semantic interpretations so `challenge_then_build_rng` accepts both paths even though only one should be valid, leading to Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/crypto/proofs/strobe_transcript.rs::challenge_then_build_rng`
- Entrypoint: `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `challenge_label`
- Exploit idea: Submit identical raw bytes for `statement encoding` under two semantic interpretations and test whether both verification paths accept them.
- Invariant to test: The same `statement encoding` bytes must not validate under multiple semantic domains, roles, or curve/group interpretations.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Construct a deterministic unit or invariant test around `crypto::proofs::strobe_transcript::challenge_then_build_rng` that feeds crafted `statement encoding` / `rng` inputs, then assert whether downstream verification accepts an output that should have been rejected.
