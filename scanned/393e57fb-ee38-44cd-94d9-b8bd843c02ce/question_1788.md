# Q1788: asset-converter split-brain via signed user flow whose on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route` on Bridge Hub Polkadot XCM and control nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution so that `FeeManager / WaivedLocations` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / WaivedLocations`
- Entrypoint: `signed user flow whose message enters BridgeHubPolkadot through a valid upstream XCM route`
- Attacker controls: nested `DescendOrigin`, `AliasOrigin`, `InitiateTransfer`, `DepositAsset`, or `Transact` instructions arranged to mutate local state mid-execution
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
