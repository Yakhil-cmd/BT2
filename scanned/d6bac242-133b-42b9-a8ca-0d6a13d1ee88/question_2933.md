# Q2933: rpc-state via index 2933

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the daemon RPC response handling in `index` (packages/api/src/wallets/index.ts) control RPC error payload shaped like success after canceling and reopening the dialog and drive the sequence preview -> mutate controlled state -> confirm so the GUI would mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state, violating the invariant that RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/wallets/index.ts` / `index`
- Entrypoint: daemon RPC response handling
- Attacker controls: RPC error payload shaped like success; after canceling and reopening the dialog
- Exploit idea: mis-handle precision for mojos, royalties, or fees in state
- Invariant to test: RPC/event data must be correlated to the correct request, service, wallet, fingerprint, and numeric precision before driving approvals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: write a unit test around the component/hook with controlled state updates and inspect the final mutation payload
