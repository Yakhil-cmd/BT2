# Q237: crowdloan-withdraw replay via ahops transfer to post on Asset Hub operations pallet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::transfer_to_post_migration_treasury` on Asset Hub operations pallet and control the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow so that `Pallet::transfer_to_post_migration_treasury` makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping, breaking the invariant that migration-related account translation helpers must not enable value movement to the wrong sovereign account, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of migrated user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/ah-ops/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::transfer_to_post_migration_treasury`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::transfer_to_post_migration_treasury`
- Attacker controls: the target block, `depositor` override, `para_id`, and whether the same storage slot is reachable through another user-visible flow
- Exploit idea: makes sovereign-account translation helpers disagree with later value-moving logic about the rightful account mapping
- Invariant to test: migration-related account translation helpers must not enable value movement to the wrong sovereign account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of migrated user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over block, depositor, and para_id combinations with one-shot-withdraw invariants
