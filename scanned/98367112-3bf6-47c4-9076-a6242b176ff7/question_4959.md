# Q4959: block index resource limit enforcement

## Question

What can an unprivileged user do by deploying WASM bytecode and invoking exported contract methods with chosen arguments so that `block_index` in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/wasmtime_runner/logic.rs` processes large transactions, WASM bytecode, method args, access-key lists, receipts, RPC parameters, and storage writes along the WASM preparation and execution path? User controls large transactions, WASM bytecode, method args, access-key lists, receipts, RPC parameters, and storage writes -> `block_index` processes that value during RPC admission, transaction validation, VM preparation/execution, trie access, and block/chunk resource accounting -> the user-controlled work is bounded by protocol gas, byte-size, recursion, proof, and queue limits before it can degrade consensus processing invariant might break -> potential in-scope impact is accepted non-network DoS, fee bypass, or consensus processing failure under the NEAR HackenProof scope. Exploit hypothesis: a valid user payload can drive this code into superlinear work or unbounded memory without paying the corresponding protocol cost, violating the actual protocol invariant that user-controlled work is bounded by protocol gas, byte-size, recursion, proof, and queue limits before it can degrade consensus processing.

## Target

- File/function: runtime/near-vm-runner/src/wasmtime_runner/logic.rs:726::block_index
- Entrypoint: contract deployment and function call executed through runtime/near-vm-runner/src/runner.rs::run
- User-controlled input: large transactions, WASM bytecode, method args, access-key lists, receipts, RPC parameters, and storage writes
- Attack path: User controls large transactions, WASM bytecode, method args, access-key lists, receipts, RPC parameters, and storage writes -> public entrypoint reaches `block_index` -> RPC admission, transaction validation, VM preparation/execution, trie access, and block/chunk resource accounting handles the value -> invariant failure could produce accepted non-network DoS, fee bypass, or consensus processing failure
- Security invariant: user-controlled work is bounded by protocol gas, byte-size, recursion, proof, and queue limits before it can degrade consensus processing
- Expected bounty impact: accepted non-network DoS, fee bypass, or consensus processing failure
- Fast validation approach: fuzz maximum-size payloads and worst-case storage/receipt patterns on a private testnet while asserting deterministic rejection or bounded gas-charged execution
