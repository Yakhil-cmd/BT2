# Q879: Mismatch commitment and share

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and pair a valid-looking `private channel` with a different `round message` reveal so `push` checks each piece in isolation but never the combined statement, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::push`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `header`, `from`, `message`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Commit to one `private channel` and reveal another `round message` that still satisfies separate local checks.
- Invariant to test: A commitment and its corresponding `private channel` reveal must be validated as the same statement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `private channel` data into `push`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
