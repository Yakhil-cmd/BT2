# Q701: alias collision on execution via xcmpallet execute on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::execute` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `TrustedTeleporters` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `TrustedTeleporters`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
