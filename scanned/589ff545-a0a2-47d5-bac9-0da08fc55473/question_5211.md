# Q5211: touch — metrics info leak under http bind

## Question
Does touch()'s MkdirAll+Chtimes+Create, addUser()'s append to /etc/passwd, and sleepForever()'s terminal state stay safe when an attacker scrapes `/metrics` from another pod in a deployment with `--http-bind` reachable from other pods in the cluster — or can sync counts, timings, and hook/askpass error counters reveal repository activity and auth failures to unauthorised callers, violating “metrics do not disclose sensitive operational detail to unauthenticated callers” and producing information disclosure enabling targeted follow-on attacks?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `touch / addUser / sleepForever`
- Entrypoint: attacker push, or an unauthenticated in-cluster request to the --http-bind port
- Attacker controls: Scrapes `/metrics` from another pod. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: sync counts, timings, and hook/askpass error counters reveal repository activity and auth failures to unauthorised callers
- Invariant to test: metrics do not disclose sensitive operational detail to unauthenticated callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: information disclosure enabling targeted follow-on attacks (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: break the sync deterministically and assert `/` stops returning 200 (or that the staleness is otherwise surfaced)
