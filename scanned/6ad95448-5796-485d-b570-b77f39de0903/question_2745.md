# Q2745: debt-remove-scaled via borrow: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, drive `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) — which clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `borrow` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-remove-scaled` touches, run `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
