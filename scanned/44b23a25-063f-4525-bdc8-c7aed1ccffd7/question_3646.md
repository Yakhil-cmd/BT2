# Q3646: cross-ceremony state bleed via runtimecall encointertreasuries signed user on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path on Encointer runtime and control offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state, breaking the invariant that XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::EncointerTreasuries` signed user path
- Attacker controls: offline payment payloads, reputation commitments, and treasury beneficiaries replayed across ceremony boundaries
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders a valid community artifact so two modules consume it as fresh state
- Invariant to test: XCM-assisted flows must not mint, unlock, or strand more value than they debit locally
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or community treasury drain
- Fast validation: xcm or proxy integration test if the path depends on aliased or remote execution
