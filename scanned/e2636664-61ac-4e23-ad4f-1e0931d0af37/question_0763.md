# Q763: cross-pallet hold mismatch via claims claim claim attest on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: fee-paying and fee-waived paths that touch the same balance, hold, reserve, or unlock bookkeeping
- Exploit idea: creates a cross-pallet ordering edge where the final state violates the intended staking, claims, or crowdloan invariant
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked withdrawal
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around the exact batch, unlock, or claim boundary
