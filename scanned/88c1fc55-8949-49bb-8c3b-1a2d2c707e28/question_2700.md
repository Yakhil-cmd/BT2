# Q2700: Reorder rounds

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and reorder attacker-controlled `ready` messages so `echo_ready_thresholds` satisfies an earlier-round check with later-round data, causing Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::echo_ready_thresholds`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `n`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Deliver later-round `ready` inputs before earlier-round receives complete and watch for premature acceptance.
- Invariant to test: Later-round `ready` data must never satisfy earlier-round `echo` checks.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `ready` data into `echo_ready_thresholds`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
