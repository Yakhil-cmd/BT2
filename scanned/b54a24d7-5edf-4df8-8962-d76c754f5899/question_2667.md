# Q2667: socialize-debt via borrow: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
`socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944) writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944` -> `socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Reach it through `borrow` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `socialize-debt` touches, run `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
