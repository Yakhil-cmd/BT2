# Q2455: repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs — url insteadof under submodules recursive

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker who gets a `url.<base>.insteadOf` rewrite into the effective config through any layer, under the default `--submodules=recursive`, so config affects submodule transports, reach a state where — in SetupDefaultGitConfigs(): gc.autoDetach=false, gc.pruneExpire=now, credential.helper=cache, core.askPass=true written to the private GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL — all later fetches, including submodules, are silently redirected while logs still show the original URL, breaking the invariant that no config layer can rewrite the configured remote URL and yielding unauthorized content published plus credential disclosure to the rewritten host?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs`
- Entrypoint: attacker-committed config-bearing content -> git invocations that read the effective config
- Attacker controls: Gets a `url.<base>.insteadOf` rewrite into the effective config through any layer. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: all later fetches, including submodules, are silently redirected while logs still show the original URL
- Invariant to test: no config layer can rewrite the configured remote URL
- Expected Immunefi impact: unauthorized content published plus credential disclosure to the rewritten host (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: dump `git config list -z` under GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL after the fixture sync and assert the effective keys equal the intended set
