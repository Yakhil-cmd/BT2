# Q2645: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - r derivable before proofs are chosen via NodeJs [a-single-item-batch-n-1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with a single-item batch (n == 1), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a single-item batch (n == 1). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check the transcript in compute_r_powers hashes commitments/z/y/proofs so r cannot be predicted then gamed (a single-item batch (n == 1)).
- Invariant to test: r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: r == H(all entries); no attacker can fix proofs after learning r (input: a single-item batch (n == 1)).
