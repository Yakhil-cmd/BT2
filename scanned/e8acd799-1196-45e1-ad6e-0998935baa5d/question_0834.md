# Q0834: voucher source extraction under failed tail call mapping uniqueness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through IBC voucher transfer path by controlling voucher denom, source channel trace, receiver and amount when a later bank, EVM, IBC, or callback step fails after earlier fund-sensitive work has run, then derive a wrong source channel for voucher redemption so that voucher routing uses the original denom trace and cannot be attacker-selected fails and one denom maps to one contract and one contract maps to one redeemable denom, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: x/cronos/keeper/params.go::GetSourceChannelID
- Entrypoint: IBC voucher transfer path
- Attacker controls: voucher denom, source channel trace, receiver and amount; scenario focus: failed tail call plus mapping uniqueness.
- Exploit idea: derive a wrong source channel for voucher redemption while a later bank, EVM, IBC, or callback step fails after earlier fund-sensitive work has run.
- Invariant to test: voucher routing uses the original denom trace and cannot be attacker-selected; also verify one denom maps to one contract and one contract maps to one redeemable denom.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: use a malicious minimal EVM contract or marshaled protobuf payload to exercise the entrypoint and inspect all state diffs.
