# Q5684: VerifyKZGProof - pairing-side/negation error via Go [two-distinct-byte-strings-a-client-belie]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: pairings_verify)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyKZGProof (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: find inputs where g1_sub/g2_sub or pairings_verify negation makes a false claim balance (two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery (input: two distinct byte strings a client believes encode the same commitment).
