# Q0408: process-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `process-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
