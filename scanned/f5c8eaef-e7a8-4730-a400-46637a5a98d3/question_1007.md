# Q1007: validate_transaction_nonce_and_fee_payer settles one authorization twice (transaction_processor.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `validate_transaction_nonce_and_fee_payer` in `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` with an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently, and have `validate_transaction_nonce_and_fee_payer` apply the same authorized effect a second time, so that the invariant "One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` -> `validate_transaction_nonce_and_fee_payer()` (around line 694)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently
- Exploit idea: Get `validate_transaction_nonce_and_fee_payer` to apply the same logical effect twice from a single user authorization by re-entering it or replaying the surrounding flow.
- Invariant to test: One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit the flow twice (and once re-entrantly) and assert the second application is rejected and balances moved once.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can claim, double-claim, or redirect epoch rewards, commission, or collected fees belonging to another stake or vote account.
