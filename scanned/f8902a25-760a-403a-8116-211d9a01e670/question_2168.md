# Q2168: wrong-asset bridge settlement via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `XcmMessageProcessor` makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths, breaking the invariant that front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks, and leading to critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `XcmMessageProcessor`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths
- Invariant to test: front-end fee conversion must not let a user spend less than the bridge path credits or unlocks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
