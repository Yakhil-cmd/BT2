# Q2733: total-supply-preview via redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, drive `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) — which adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-supply-preview` touches, run `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
