# Q4430: RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs - recovered polynomial exceeds the degree bound via CSharp [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply cells consistent on the given indices but not of degree < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB and see if recovery returns cells/proofs anyway (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
