# Q5445: check-confidence via liquidate: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `debt-amount`, drive `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) — which compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `liquidate` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `check-confidence` touches, run `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
