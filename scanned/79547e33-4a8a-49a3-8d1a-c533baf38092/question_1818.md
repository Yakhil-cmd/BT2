# Q1818: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - infinity commitment inside a batch via Rust [an-on-curve-point-outside-the-order-r-g1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch true iff every triple's pairing holds, infinity commitment included so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: include a triple whose commitment is the point at infinity and see if aggregation accepts it (an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup).
- Invariant to test: batch true iff every triple's pairing holds, infinity commitment included.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: batch true iff every triple's pairing holds, infinity commitment included (input: an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup).
