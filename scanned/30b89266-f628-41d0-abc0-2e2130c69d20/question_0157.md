# Q0157: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate-multi: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) — which chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `calc-liquidation-params` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
