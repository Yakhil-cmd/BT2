# Q1440: total-assets-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `total-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
