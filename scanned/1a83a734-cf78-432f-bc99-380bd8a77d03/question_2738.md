# Q2738: write_section_headers is not deterministic across nodes (program.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `write_section_headers` in `xdp/src/program.rs` with state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another, and make the packets marked signature-verified disagree with the packets whose signatures were actually checked, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `write_section_headers` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/program.rs` -> `write_section_headers()` (around line 199)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another
- Exploit idea: Find input to `write_section_headers` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `write_section_headers` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `write_section_headers` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft native-program input that makes honest nodes compute different stake, vote, or reward state, diverging epoch stakes, leader schedule, or bank hash.
