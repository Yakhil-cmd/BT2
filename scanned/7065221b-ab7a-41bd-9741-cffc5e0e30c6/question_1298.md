# Q1298: RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs - recovered proofs match recovered cells via CSharp [a-blob-whose-4096-field-elements-are-all]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch over recovered cells/proofs == true so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: compute_fk20_cell_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.RecoverCellsAndKzgProofs via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm the recomputed proofs verify against the recovered cells and original commitment (a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
- Invariant to test: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch over recovered cells/proofs == true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch over recovered cells/proofs == true (input: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
