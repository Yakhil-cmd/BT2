# Q3691: mask-to-list-collateral via borrow: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `borrow` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `mask-to-list-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
