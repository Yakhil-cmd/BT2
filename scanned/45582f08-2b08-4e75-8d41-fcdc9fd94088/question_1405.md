# Q1405: accrue-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) — which accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `accrue-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
