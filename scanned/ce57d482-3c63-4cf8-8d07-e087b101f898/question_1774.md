# Q1774: [no-secret organization] `pull_request` action=`opened` -> OpenedHandler on a review_stacks_enabled false stack

## Question
Combining the `no-secret organization` verification gap (attacker sets `repository.owner.login` to a GitHub org that is configured in Shipit but whose config carries no `webhook_secret`) with a `pull_request` action=`opened` event against a victim stack where review_stacks_enabled false, can an unprivileged attacker make `OpenedHandler` (provisions a `ReviewStack` from `params.pull_request.head.ref` via `ReviewStackAdapter#find_or_create!`) cause impact because review stacks are supposedly disabled yet the provision? precedence bug still provisions?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/pull_request/opened_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `pull_request` body action=`opened`, signature/headers; sets `repository.owner.login` to a GitHub org that is configured in Shipit but whose config carries no `webhook_secret`; victim stack has review_stacks_enabled false
- Exploit idea: `GitHubApp#verify_webhook_signature` returns `true` immediately when `webhook_secret` is blank, so the forged body is accepted without any HMAC; `OpenedHandler` provisions a `ReviewStack` from `params.pull_request.head.ref` via `ReviewStackAdapter#find_or_create!`; review stacks are supposedly disabled yet the provision? precedence bug still provisions amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `pull_request` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of review_stacks_enabled false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Remote Code Execution on the Shipit deploy host (HackerOne/Immunefi RCE class)
- Fast validation: minitest: under `no-secret organization`, forge `pull_request` action=`opened` for a review_stacks_enabled false stack, assert the downstream effect.
