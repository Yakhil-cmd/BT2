# Q0992: mask-shift-combine via supply-collateral-add: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to reach `mask-shift-combine` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422` -> `mask-shift-combine`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to varied, and assert that the value `mask-shift-combine` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
