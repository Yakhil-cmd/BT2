# Q4970: verify_blob_kzg_proof - non-canonical blob element in verify via Rust [a-value-that-is-canonical-little-endian]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: blob_to_polynomial)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in the blob and confirm blob_to_polynomial rejects before pairing (a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
- Invariant to test: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_blob_kzg_proof.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: each blob element == canonical decode, else BADARGS and *ok stays false (input: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
