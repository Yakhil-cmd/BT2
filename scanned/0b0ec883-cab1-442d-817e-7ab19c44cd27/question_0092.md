# Q92: stale proof replay via pallet remote proxy remote on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_remote_proxy::remote_proxy` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::remote_proxy` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `pallet_remote_proxy::remote_proxy`
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: local-to-remote account conversion and remote-to-local proxy mapping must not widen authority or collide between users
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
