# Q937: crowdloan exit inconsistency via proxy proxy multisig as on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Kusama Relay runtime and control crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries so that `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config` forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules, breaking the invariant that one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_rc_migrator::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: crowdloan contribution and withdrawal timing around lease expiry and unlock boundaries
- Exploit idea: forces a state transition that should be blocked by lock, freeze, pending-unlock, or announcement rules
- Invariant to test: one pool share, claim, contribution, or unlock chunk may only be exited or consumed once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
