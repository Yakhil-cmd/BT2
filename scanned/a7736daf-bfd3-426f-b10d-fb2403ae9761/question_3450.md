# Q3450: resolve-dia via liquidate-redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
