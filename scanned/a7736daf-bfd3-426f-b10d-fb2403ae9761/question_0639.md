# Q0639: calc-multiplier-delta via collateral-remove: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-multiplier-delta` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
