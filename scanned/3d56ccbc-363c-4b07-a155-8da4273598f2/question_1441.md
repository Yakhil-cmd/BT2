# Q1441: destination-credit loss via assets transfer transfer keep on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds, breaking the invariant that approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes, and leading to high - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or xcm path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: asset ids, approvals, beneficiaries, and balance shapes spanning native, foreign, and pool assets
- Exploit idea: reaches a path where fee charging, asset conversion, and final settlement observe different balances or asset kinds
- Invariant to test: approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on a critical asset-transfer or XCM path
- Fast validation: differential test that compares approval or proof validity before and after the economic state change
