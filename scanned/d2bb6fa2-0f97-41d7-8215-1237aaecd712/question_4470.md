# Q4470: get-liquidation-position via supply-collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, so the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `get-liquidation-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
