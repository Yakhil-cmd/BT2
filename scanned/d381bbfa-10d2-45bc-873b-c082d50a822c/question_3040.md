# Q3040: get-egroup via repay: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `repay` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
