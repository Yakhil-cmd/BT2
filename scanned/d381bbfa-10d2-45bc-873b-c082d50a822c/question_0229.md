# Q0229: write-feeds via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) — which folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator — to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, breaking the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `amount`, then read `write-feeds` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
