# Q2216: wrong-asset bridge settlement via assetconversion create pool add on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset on Snowbridge runtime path and control bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue_v2::Config` makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue_v2::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset
- Attacker controls: bridge payloads that mix local assets, foreign assets, and Ethereum-network locations
- Exploit idea: makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
