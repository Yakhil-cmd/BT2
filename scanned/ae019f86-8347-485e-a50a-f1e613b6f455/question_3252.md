# Q3252: beneficiary resolution split via coretimepolkadot pallet xcm execute on Coretime Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Coretime Polkadot XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / ExecuteXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `CoretimePolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
