# Q4474: recoverCellsAndKzgProofs - strict-ascending index check via Zig [an-ascending-list-with-one-column-index]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via root.zig` with an ascending list with one column index repeated later, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an ascending list with one column index repeated later. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: submit indices that are not strictly ascending and confirm the C_KZG_BADARGS guard fires before any write (an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
- Invariant to test: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: recovery rejects non-ascending/duplicate indices before touching recovered_cells_fr (input: an ascending list with one column index repeated later).
