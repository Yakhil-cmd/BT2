# Q0160: vault-accrue via collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
