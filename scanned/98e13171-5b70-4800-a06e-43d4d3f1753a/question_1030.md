# Q1030: claim-path state divergence via claims claim claim attest on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Claims::{claim, claim_attest, move_claim}`
- Attacker controls: attacker-chosen claim parameters, destination accounts, or attestation ordering
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: claimable value must never exceed backing funds or issuance
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
