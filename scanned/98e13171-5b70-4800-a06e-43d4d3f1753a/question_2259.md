# Q2259: bridge-message reorder via assethubpolkadot pallet xcm send on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` on Snowbridge runtime path and control token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow so that `CreateAssetCall / SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match, breaking the invariant that bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `CreateAssetCall / SnowbridgeFrontendLocation`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation`
- Attacker controls: token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow
- Exploit idea: replays or reorders bridge messages so asset creation, reserve assignment, and unlock settlement no longer match
- Invariant to test: bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
