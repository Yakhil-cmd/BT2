# Q2870: [nil / malformed signature split] `pull_request` action=`unassigned` -> AssignedHandler on a merge_queue_enabled true stack

## Question
Combining the `nil / malformed signature split` verification gap (attacker sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`) with a `pull_request` action=`unassigned` event against a victim stack where merge_queue_enabled true, can an unprivileged attacker make `AssignedHandler` (updates the persisted `PullRequest` record on assignee change) cause impact because a green head advances the merge queue and `merge!` fires?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/pull_request/assigned_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `pull_request` body action=`unassigned`, signature/headers; sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`; victim stack has merge_queue_enabled true
- Exploit idea: the comparison inputs are attacker-shaped and, for a no-secret org, never reached because verification short-circuits to true; `AssignedHandler` updates the persisted `PullRequest` record on assignee change; a green head advances the merge queue and `merge!` fires amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `pull_request` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of merge_queue_enabled true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Unauthorized deploy/rollback/merge of attacker-controlled code
- Fast validation: minitest: under `nil / malformed signature split`, forge `pull_request` action=`unassigned` for a merge_queue_enabled true stack, assert the downstream effect.
