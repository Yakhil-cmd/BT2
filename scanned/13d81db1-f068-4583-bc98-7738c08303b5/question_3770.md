# Q3770: remote-payout beneficiary split via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer so that `TransferOverXcm::transfer` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to high - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::transfer`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: query ids, timeout windows, and replayed payment-status checks around the same remote transfer
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck remote payout queue with concrete fund impact
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
