# Q688: waived-execution bypass via xcmpallet transfer assets on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::transfer_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / Aliasers` induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: induces a state where execution succeeds but assets are trapped, miscredited, replayed, or double-accounted across local and remote representations
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
