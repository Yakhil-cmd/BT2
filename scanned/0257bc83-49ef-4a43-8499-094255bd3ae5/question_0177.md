# Q177: proof-stack confusion via utility batch all register on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination so that `RemoteProxyInterface::local_to_remote_account_id / remote_to_local_proxy_defintion` resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch, breaking the invariant that a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `RemoteProxyInterface::local_to_remote_account_id / remote_to_local_proxy_defintion`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])`
- Attacker controls: a wrapped call, proxy type, and proof bundle that are valid separately but dangerous in combination
- Exploit idea: resolves the proof, real account, or proxy definition against different identities across validation and dispatch
- Invariant to test: a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: unit test stale-proof reuse after remote revocation and root-window rollover
