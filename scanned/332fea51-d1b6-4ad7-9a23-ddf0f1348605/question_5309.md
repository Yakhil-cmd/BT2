# Q5309: debt-preview via redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, drive `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
