# Q2391: find-collateral-amount via borrow: prime shared state so the next caller in the block is eval

## Question
`find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it, violating the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `borrow` and prime shared state so the next caller in the block is evaluated against it.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-collateral-amount` touches, run `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
