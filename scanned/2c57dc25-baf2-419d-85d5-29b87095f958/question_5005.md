# Q5005: normalize via call-ststx-ratio: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, drive `normalize` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576) — which divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar — to push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576` -> `normalize`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `normalize` divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, then read `normalize` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
