# Q2966: accrue-user-collateral via collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
