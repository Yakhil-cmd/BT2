# Q3334: verify_blob_kzg_proof - zero blob acceptance via Rust [recovery-from-65-cells-one-recoverable-c]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok true iff the commitment/proof are the genuine ones for the zero polynomial so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::verify_blob_kzg_proof (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify an all-zero blob against a crafted commitment/proof pair (recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
- Invariant to test: *ok true iff the commitment/proof are the genuine ones for the zero polynomial.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_verify_blob_kzg_proof.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: *ok true iff the commitment/proof are the genuine ones for the zero polynomial (input: recovery from 65 cells (one recoverable column)).
