# Q1530: send-tokens via liquidate-multi: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `send-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
