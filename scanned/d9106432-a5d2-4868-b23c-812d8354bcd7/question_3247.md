# Q3247: repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs — scanner goroutine leak under default config

## Question
Does SetupDefaultGitConfigs(): gc.autoDetach=false, gc.pruneExpire=now, credential.helper=cache, core.askPass=true written to the private GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL stay safe when an attacker supplies very large or pathological config strings in the default configuration git-sync installs at startup — or can the feeding goroutine and buffered channel in parseGitConfigs() retain memory per call, violating “config parsing is O(n) with no retained state” and producing memory growth in a long-lived sidecar?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `repoSync.SetupDefaultGitConfigs`
- Entrypoint: attacker-committed config-bearing content -> git invocations that read the effective config
- Attacker controls: Supplies very large or pathological config strings. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: the feeding goroutine and buffered channel in parseGitConfigs() retain memory per call
- Invariant to test: config parsing is O(n) with no retained state
- Expected Immunefi impact: memory growth in a long-lived sidecar (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: sync the fixture and assert no repo-supplied config layer changed transport, alias, hook, or credential behaviour
