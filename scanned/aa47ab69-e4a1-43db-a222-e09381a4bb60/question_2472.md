# Q2472: referendum replay via preimage note preimage unnote on Collectives Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Preimage::{note_preimage, unnote_preimage}` on Collectives Polkadot runtime and control preimages, deposits, and dispatchable calls whose execution is later scheduled or referendum-driven so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a preimage, deposit, or scheduled effect be consumed more than once or cleaned up too early, breaking the invariant that scheduled or post-referendum consequences must stay bound to the exact authorized preimage and deposit state, and leading to high - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Preimage::{note_preimage, unnote_preimage}`
- Attacker controls: preimages, deposits, and dispatchable calls whose execution is later scheduled or referendum-driven
- Exploit idea: lets a preimage, deposit, or scheduled effect be consumed more than once or cleaned up too early
- Invariant to test: scheduled or post-referendum consequences must stay bound to the exact authorized preimage and deposit state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe scheduling or queue corruption with concrete protocol impact
- Fast validation: xcm test if the path depends on aliased pluralities or remote execution
