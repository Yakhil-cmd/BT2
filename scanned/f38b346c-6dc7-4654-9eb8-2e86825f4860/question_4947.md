# Q4947: Commit body-header mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Commit` through peer-supplied block body associated with a candidate header using header and body fields, ancestry claims, seal bytes, validator ordering, and packet timing and make `Commit` validate a header against one body but persist or execute another, causing the invariant that the body executed and persisted for a block must be the exact body committed by the accepted header to fail and leading to Transaction manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: consensus/istanbul/backend/backend.go:303 (Commit)
- Entrypoint: peer-supplied block body associated with a candidate header
- Attacker controls: header and body fields, ancestry claims, seal bytes, validator ordering, and packet timing
- Exploit idea: make `Commit` validate a header against one body but persist or execute another
- Invariant to test: the body executed and persisted for a block must be the exact body committed by the accepted header
- Expected Immunefi impact: Transaction manipulation
- Fast validation: supply conflicting bodies for the same header and assert execution, persistence, and receipts stay bound to one payload
