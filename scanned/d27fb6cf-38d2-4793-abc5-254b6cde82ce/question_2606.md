# Q2606: slash-routing confusion via assets transfer transfer approved on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}` on People Polkadot runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, Assets, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of identity or asset balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Identity, Assets, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of identity or asset balances
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
