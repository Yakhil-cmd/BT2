# Q532: waived-execution bypass via xcmpallet teleport assets on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::teleport_assets` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `SovereignAccountOf` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
