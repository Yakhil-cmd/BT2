# Q69: verifyKzgProof - pairing-side/negation error via Zig [the-compressed-point-at-infinity-0xc0-th]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/zig Settings.verifyKzgProof via root.zig` with the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: pairings_verify)
- Entrypoint: bindings/zig Settings.verifyKzgProof via root.zig; the wrapper returns error.LengthMismatch on unequal lengths and passes slice.len as the count
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: find inputs where g1_sub/g2_sub or pairings_verify negation makes a false claim balance (the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
- Invariant to test: *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/zig/src/tests.zig asserting the invariant holds: *ok == true iff C-[y] and pi,[s-z] pair equal; no sign error accepts a forgery (input: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
