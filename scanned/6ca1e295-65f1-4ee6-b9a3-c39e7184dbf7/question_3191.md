# Q3191: compute_cells - FK20 circulant stride mapping via Rust [recovery-from-exactly-cells-per-blob-64]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates)` with recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that cells derived from x_ext_fft_columns == the reference cells so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: circulant_coeffs_stride)
- Entrypoint: bindings/rust KZGSettings::compute_cells (used by Reth/Lighthouse-adjacent crates); the wrapper checks slice lengths, casts len() as u64, and reads a MaybeUninit<bool> only on C_KZG_OK
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm circulant_coeffs_stride maps blob coefficients into the 2r circulant vector as the paper/spec dictates (recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
- Invariant to test: cells derived from x_ext_fft_columns == the reference cells.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: the differential fuzzer fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs.rs (`cargo fuzz`, vs Rust-Eth-KZG/Constantine) or a #[test] in bindings/rust asserting the invariant holds: cells derived from x_ext_fft_columns == the reference cells (input: recovery from exactly CELLS_PER_BLOB = 64 cells).
