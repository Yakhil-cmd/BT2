# Q5175: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - non-canonical cell field element via Python [a-value-that-is-canonical-little-endian]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_commitment_to_aggregated_interpolation_poly)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: put a non-canonical element in a cell; note the challenge hashes raw bytes before bytes_to_bls_field validates them (a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
- Invariant to test: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: the field element aggregated == canonical decode of the cell bytes, else BADARGS before *ok can be true (input: a value that is canonical little-endian but non-canonical big-endian).
