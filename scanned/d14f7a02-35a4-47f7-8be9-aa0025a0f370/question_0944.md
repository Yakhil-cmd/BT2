# Q944: verify_blob_kzg_proof - evaluation shortcut soundness via C [r-1-smallest-non-canonical-scalar]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with r+1 (smallest non-canonical scalar), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: r+1 (smallest non-canonical scalar). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: target the fr_equal shortcut branch during verification (r+1 (smallest non-canonical scalar)).
- Invariant to test: shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge (input: r+1 (smallest non-canonical scalar)).
