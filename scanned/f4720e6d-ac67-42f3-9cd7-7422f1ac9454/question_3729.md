# Q3729: fee-asset undercharge path via encointer pallet xcm execute on Encointer XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Encointer::pallet_xcm::execute` on Encointer XCM and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / SendXcmOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Encointer::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: targeted integration test proving whether the message can reach export, teleport, reserve, or transact paths it should never reach
