# Q1293: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs - recovered output matches the reference via Elixir [a-blob-whose-4096-field-elements-are-all]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovered (cells,proofs) == the reference recovery for the same inputs so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: differentially compare recovered cells/proofs against Rust-Eth-KZG (a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
- Invariant to test: recovered (cells,proofs) == the reference recovery for the same inputs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: recovered (cells,proofs) == the reference recovery for the same inputs (input: a blob whose 4096 field elements are all zero).
