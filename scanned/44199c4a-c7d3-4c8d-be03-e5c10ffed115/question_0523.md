# Q523: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet execute on Polkadot Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::execute` on Polkadot Relay XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `FeeManager / Aliasers` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path, and leading to critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `FeeManager / Aliasers`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::execute`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: the same XCM message must never be treated as both paid and fee-waived for the same execution path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked asset mint, unlock, or withdrawal
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
