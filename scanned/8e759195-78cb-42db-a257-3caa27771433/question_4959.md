# Q4959: get-position via liquidate-redeem: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, violating the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-position` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
