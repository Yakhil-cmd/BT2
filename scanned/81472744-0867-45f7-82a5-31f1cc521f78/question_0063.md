# Q0063: merge-price via collateral-remove: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
`merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `merge-price` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
