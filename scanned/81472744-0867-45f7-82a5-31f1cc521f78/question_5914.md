# Q5914: get-position via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, so the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
