# Q2166: total-supply-preview via accrue: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `accrue` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the utilization the rate is interpolated at across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `total-supply-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
