# Q2145: bridge-settlement mismatch via bridgehubpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues, breaking the invariant that bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{BridgeRelayers, BridgeKusamaMessages, EthereumInboundQueue, EthereumInboundQueueV2, EthereumOutboundQueueV2, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues
- Invariant to test: bridge queues, XCM routing, and final beneficiary accounting must stay mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or duplicated settlement
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
