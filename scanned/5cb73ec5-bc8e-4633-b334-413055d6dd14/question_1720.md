# Q1720: resolve-or-create via repay: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) in a state where it seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against? Given that it allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `repay` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
