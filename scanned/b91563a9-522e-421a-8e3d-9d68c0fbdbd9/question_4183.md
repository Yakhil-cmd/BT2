# Q4183: verifyBlobKzgProof - verify accepts compute output via Nim [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.verifyBlobKzgProof (used by Nimbus)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify(compute(blob)) == true for every blob so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: compute_challenge)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.verifyBlobKzgProof (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: confirm verify_blob_kzg_proof accepts the proof compute_blob_kzg_proof made for the same blob (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: verify(compute(blob)) == true for every blob.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: verify(compute(blob)) == true for every blob (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
