# Q1163: can_data_be_changed can be driven into unbounded work (instruction_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `can_data_be_changed` in `transaction-context/src/instruction_accounts.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and make `can_data_be_changed` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `can_data_be_changed` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/instruction_accounts.rs` -> `can_data_be_changed()` (around line 338)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `can_data_be_changed` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `can_data_be_changed` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `can_data_be_changed` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
