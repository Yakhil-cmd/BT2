# Q1034: Interpolate on malicious subset

## Question
Can a single malicious participant or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign::presign(...)` and steer `participants`, `args`, `protocol message timing` so `presign` interpolates `beta share` over an attacker-influenced subset that is algebraically inconsistent with the honest transcript, leading to Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/ecdsa/ot_based_ecdsa/presign.rs::presign`
- Entrypoint: `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign::presign(...)`
- Attacker controls: `participants`, `args`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Force interpolation over attacker-selected indices, then compare the reconstructed `beta share` against the honest relation.
- Invariant to test: Interpolation must only use the intended threshold-sized honest-consistent subset for `beta share`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `ecdsa::ot_based_ecdsa::presign::presign(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `beta share` data into `presign`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
