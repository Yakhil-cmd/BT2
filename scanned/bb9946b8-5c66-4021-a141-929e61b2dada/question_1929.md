# Q1929: collateral-add via liquidate-redeem: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) — which evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `collateral-add` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
