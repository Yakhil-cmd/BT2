# Q1807: get_enum_tag confuses account types or owners (index_entry.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `get_enum_tag` in `bucket_map/src/index_entry.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and have `get_enum_tag` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_enum_tag` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/index_entry.rs` -> `get_enum_tag()` (around line 126)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_enum_tag` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_enum_tag` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_enum_tag` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
