# Q847: proxy-batch privilege widening via proxy proxy multisig as on Polkadot Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` on Polkadot Relay runtime and control a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}` obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Staking, NominationPools, Claims, Crowdloan, XcmPallet, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all`
- Attacker controls: a batched combination of proxy, multisig, XCM, and staking-related calls in one transaction
- Exploit idea: obtains a second payout, claim, or withdrawal after a first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test comparing pre and post balances, holds, reserves, and points
