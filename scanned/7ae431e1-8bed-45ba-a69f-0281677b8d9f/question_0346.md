# Q346: verifyCellKzgProofBatch - deduplicate_commitments compares bytes not points via NodeJs [the-compressed-point-at-infinity-0xc0-th]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: deduplicate_commitments)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.verifyCellKzgProofBatch via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply two commitment encodings a client thinks are equal/unequal and see if deduplicate_commitments splits or merges them wrongly (the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
- Invariant to test: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: commitments dedupe iff they are the same group element, matching the reference (input: the compressed point at infinity (0xc0 then 47 zero bytes)).
