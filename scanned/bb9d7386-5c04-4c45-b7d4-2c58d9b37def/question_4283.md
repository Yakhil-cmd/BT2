# Q4283: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - large-n allocation/size arithmetic via Nim [a-batch-whose-proofs-are-permuted-relati]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/nim kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch (used by Nimbus)` with a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs so that one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/nim kzg.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch (used by Nimbus); the wrapper takes openArray[0].getPtr and passes len.uint64, returning ok(true) on empty batches
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: drive input_size = DOMAIN + 2*u64 + n*(commit+2*fe+proof) toward size_t overflow (a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
- Invariant to test: the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - one attacker-published blob/sidecar aborts or corrupts memory in every node linking c-kzg (reachable assert / OOB / UB), a network-wide liveness fault.
- Fast validation: a test in bindings/nim/tests/tests.nim asserting the invariant holds: the malloc size == the exact transcript length; no multiply wraps and no OOB write occurs (input: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
