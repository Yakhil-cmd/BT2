# Q3533: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch - coset-shift index collision via C [a-duplicated-index-pair-k-k-for-the-same]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code` with a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: get_inv_coset_shift_for_cell)
- Entrypoint: Linked C ABI (src/ckzg.c) called by a client's blob-pool / DAS code; the client passes the raw pointer and a trusted `n`/`num_cells` straight to C with no length re-check
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: find two cell indices whose reverse_bits_limited coset factor maps to the same roots_of_unity shift (a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
- Invariant to test: each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a tinytest case in src/test/tests.c (`make -C src test`) that load_trusted_setup_file()s trusted_setup.txt and asserts the invariant holds: each column's coset shift == its unique h_k; no two columns share a shift (input: a duplicated index pair (k, k) for the same commitment).
