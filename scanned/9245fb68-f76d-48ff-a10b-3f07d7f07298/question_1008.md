# Q1008: Mismatch commitment and share

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and pair a valid-looking `message buffer` with a different `channel tag` reveal so `send_raw` checks each piece in isolation but never the combined statement, causing Cryptographic flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/internal.rs::send_raw`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `data`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Commit to one `message buffer` and reveal another `channel tag` that still satisfies separate local checks.
- Invariant to test: A commitment and its corresponding `message buffer` reveal must be validated as the same statement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `message buffer` data into `send_raw`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
