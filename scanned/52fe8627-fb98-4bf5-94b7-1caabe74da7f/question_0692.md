# Q0692: resolve-pyth via collateral-remove: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `resolve-pyth` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
