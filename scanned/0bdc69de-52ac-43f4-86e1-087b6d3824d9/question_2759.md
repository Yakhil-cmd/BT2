# Q2759: username-expiry accounting drift via identity set identity clear on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Polkadot identity config and control locations or treasury-routing state that receive slashed identity deposits so that `IdentityAdminOrigin` causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable, breaking the invariant that username and sub-account lifecycle state must not strand or duplicate user funds, and leading to high - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `IdentityAdminOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: locations or treasury-routing state that receive slashed identity deposits
- Exploit idea: causes `IdentityInfo`, deposit accounting, and treasury-routing logic to disagree about how much value remains claimable
- Invariant to test: username and sub-account lifecycle state must not strand or duplicate user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unauthorized state transition affecting another account or treasury routing
- Fast validation: targeted test proving whether treasury routing resolves to the expected account after adversarial input
