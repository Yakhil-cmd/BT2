# Q2554: main (GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL setup) — url insteadof under gc always

## Question
Under `--git-gc=always`, so maintenance config matters every period, an attacker gets a `url.<base>.insteadOf` rewrite into the effective config through any layer. In the private gitconfig tempfile plus GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM, and the `git config list -z` dump that is logged, can that mean all later fetches, including submodules, are silently redirected while logs still show the original URL, so that the invariant “no config layer can rewrite the configured remote URL” no longer holds and the outcome is unauthorized content published plus credential disclosure to the rewritten host?

## Target
- File/function: [main.go](main.go) — `main (GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL setup)`
- Entrypoint: attacker-committed config-bearing content -> git invocations that read the effective config
- Attacker controls: Gets a `url.<base>.insteadOf` rewrite into the effective config through any layer. Unprivileged: can push commits/branches/tags to the synced repo (or otherwise control the refs and objects git-sync fetches), reach the --http-bind port, or read the --root volume as a non-root co-tenant. Cannot set flags/env/secrets, cannot exec into the container, is not the operator, node, or remote host owner.
- Exploit idea: all later fetches, including submodules, are silently redirected while logs still show the original URL
- Invariant to test: no config layer can rewrite the configured remote URL
- Expected Immunefi impact: unauthorized content published plus credential disclosure to the rewritten host (Kubernetes bug-bounty in-scope class; this repo has no Immunefi/HackenProof program — see SECURITY.md)
- Fast validation: fuzz parseGitConfigs() against git's own parser and assert identical key/value pairs or a clean error
