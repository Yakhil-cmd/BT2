# Q4545: get-egroup via borrow: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) — which resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `borrow` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-egroup` touches, run `borrow` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
