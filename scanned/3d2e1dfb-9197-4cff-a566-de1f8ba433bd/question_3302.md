# Q3302: burn-accounting drift via utility batch all around on Coretime allocator logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block on Coretime allocator logic and control XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic so that `BurnCoretimeRevenue` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-polkadot/src/coretime.rs` :: `BurnCoretimeRevenue`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all` around multiple Broker effects in one block
- Attacker controls: XCM execution that lands in the same block as coretime purchase, burn, or assignment logic
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked coretime credit
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
