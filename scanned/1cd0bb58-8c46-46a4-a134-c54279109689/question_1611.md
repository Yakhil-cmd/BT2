# Q1611: VerifyKzgProof - accept an infinity commitment via CSharp [an-on-curve-point-outside-the-order-r-g1]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that *ok == true only if e(C-[y]G1,G2)==e(pi,[s-z]G2) truly holds for the decoded C so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: validate_kzg_g1)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyKzgProof via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: pass the point at infinity as the commitment (validate_kzg_g1 accepts it before the subgroup check) with a matching chosen y and proof (an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup).
- Invariant to test: *ok == true only if e(C-[y]G1,G2)==e(pi,[s-z]G2) truly holds for the decoded C.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: *ok == true only if e(C-[y]G1,G2)==e(pi,[s-z]G2) truly holds for the decoded C (input: an on-curve point outside the order-r G1 subgroup).
