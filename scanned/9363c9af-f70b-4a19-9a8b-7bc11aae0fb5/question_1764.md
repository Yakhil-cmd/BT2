# Q1764: refresh via liquidate-multi: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `refresh` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
