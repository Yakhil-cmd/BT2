# Q3884: merge-price via call-ststx-ratio: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched varied, and assert that the value `merge-price` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
