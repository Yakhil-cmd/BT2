# Q5878: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch - C_minus_y / r_times_z indexing via Python [a-batch-mixing-a-valid-entry-with-one-wh]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: look for an index or ordering error between C_minus_y[i], r_times_z[i] and r_powers[i] (a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity).
- Invariant to test: entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: entry i's contribution uses commitment i, z i, y i, proof i and r^i, never a crossed index (input: a batch mixing a valid entry with one whose proof is the point at infinity).
