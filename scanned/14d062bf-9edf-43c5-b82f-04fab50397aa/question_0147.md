# Q147: rpc-state via ServiceConnectionName 147

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through the RTK query cache update in `ServiceConnectionName` (packages/api/src/constants/ServiceConnectionName.ts) control large numeric fields near JS precision limits with a stale Redux cache and drive the sequence connect -> approve -> switch context -> execute so the GUI would poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts, violating the invariant that error states must not be treated as successful authorization, leading to High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/api/src/constants/ServiceConnectionName.ts` / `ServiceConnectionName`
- Entrypoint: RTK query cache update
- Attacker controls: large numeric fields near JS precision limits; with a stale Redux cache
- Exploit idea: poison cached wallet/offer/NFT state used by later approval prompts
- Invariant to test: error states must not be treated as successful authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unsafe trust of RPC/event state causing wrong approval, wrong asset display, or unauthorized wallet action
- Fast validation: exercise the Electron IPC or WalletConnect command handler with crafted params and assert approval classification is strict
