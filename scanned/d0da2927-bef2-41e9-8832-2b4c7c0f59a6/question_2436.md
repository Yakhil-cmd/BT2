# Q2436: verify_kzg_proof - non-canonical y accepted via Python [an-all-0xff-32-byte-string-2-255-non-can]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/python ckzg.verify_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients)` with an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that y used == canonical decode of y_bytes, else C_KZG_BADARGS and *ok stays false so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_kzg_proof (helper: bytes_to_bls_field)
- Entrypoint: bindings/python ckzg.verify_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c (spec / tooling clients); counts are derived from PyBytes_Size/list length and each cell index goes through PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply a y above the modulus and confirm bytes_to_bls_field rejects before pairing (an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical)).
- Invariant to test: y used == canonical decode of y_bytes, else C_KZG_BADARGS and *ok stays false.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/python/tests.py asserting the invariant holds: y used == canonical decode of y_bytes, else C_KZG_BADARGS and *ok stays false (input: an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical)).
