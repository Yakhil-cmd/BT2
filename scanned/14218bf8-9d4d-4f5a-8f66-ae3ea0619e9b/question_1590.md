# Q1590: approval or proof replay via ahops unreserve lease deposit on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed, breaking the invariant that approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: reuses an approval, proof, or queued call after the economic precondition that justified it has changed
- Invariant to test: approvals, proofs, and queued calls must expire or fail once their authorizing state changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or unbacked asset issuance
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact reserve, teleport, or exporter flow and asserts no value drift
