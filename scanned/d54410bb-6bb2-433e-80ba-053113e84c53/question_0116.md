# Q0116: vault-accrue via accrue: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `accrue` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the utilization the rate is interpolated at varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
