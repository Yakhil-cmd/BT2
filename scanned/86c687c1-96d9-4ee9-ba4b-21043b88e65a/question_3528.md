# Q3528: Bypass proof binding

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and control `item`, `protocol message timing` so `insert_or_increase_counter` accepts a `message buffer` proof, commitment, or hash that is not bound to the exact sender/session/role context, leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::insert_or_increase_counter`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `item`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Pair a proof/hash for one sender or session with a different `message buffer` payload and see whether the binding check is incomplete.
- Invariant to test: Proofs, commitments, and hashes must be bound to the exact sender, session, and role they certify.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `message buffer` data into `insert_or_increase_counter`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
