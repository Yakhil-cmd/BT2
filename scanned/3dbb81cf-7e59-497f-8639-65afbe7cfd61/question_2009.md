# Q2009: VerifyCellKZGProofBatch - cell batch equals per-cell checks via Go [a-64-item-batch-with-exactly-one-crafted]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyCellKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm)` with a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that batch verdict == AND of the per-cell single-tuple verdicts so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_cell_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/go ckzg4844.VerifyCellKZGProofBatch (used by Geth/Erigon/Prysm); the wrapper reslices with unsafe.Pointer and casts len() to C.uint64_t with no per-element bound
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: verify each cell tuple alone (n=1) and batched and require identical verdicts (a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
- Invariant to test: batch verdict == AND of the per-cell single-tuple verdicts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a table test in bindings/go/main_test.go asserting the invariant holds: batch verdict == AND of the per-cell single-tuple verdicts (input: a 64-item batch with exactly one crafted entry).
