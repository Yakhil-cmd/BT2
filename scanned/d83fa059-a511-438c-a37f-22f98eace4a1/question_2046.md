# Q2046: bridge-path availability wedge via bridgerelayers signed stake or on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path` on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues, breaking the invariant that relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering, and leading to high - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `BridgeRelayers signed stake or claim path`
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues
- Invariant to test: relayer rewards and message settlement must not be replayable, swappable, or stranded by attacker-controlled ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck bridge queue or persistent denial of service on the bridge path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator or bridge integration test that follows the valid user path from source chain to Bridge Hub settlement
