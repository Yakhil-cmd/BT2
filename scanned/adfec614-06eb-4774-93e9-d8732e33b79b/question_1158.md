# Q1158: message-export route confusion via polkadotxcm teleport assets on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets` on Asset Hub Polkadot XCM and control a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape so that `PoolAssetsExchanger` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `PoolAssetsExchanger`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: a HOLLAR-like foreign asset whose reserve classification changes depending on origin and asset shape
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
