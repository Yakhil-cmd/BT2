# Q2090: bridge-path availability wedge via proxy proxy multisig as on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls on Bridge Hub Polkadot runtime and control an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues, breaking the invariant that signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Multisig::as_multi` / `Utility::batch_all` around bridge-related calls
- Attacker controls: an execution path that alternates between paid execution, explicitly unpaid execution, and refund handling
- Exploit idea: induces a state where a valid bridge action permanently wedges a critical message path or leaves funds trapped between queues
- Invariant to test: signed users must not widen bridge privileges through proxying, batching, or aliased XCM execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged assets
- Fast validation: integration test over reward claim and settlement finalization if a relayer path is involved
