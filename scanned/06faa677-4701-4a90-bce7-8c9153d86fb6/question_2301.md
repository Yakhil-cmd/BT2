# Q2301: bridge-fee swap drift via snowbridgesystemfrontend signed bridge path on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot on Snowbridge runtime path and control repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config` makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths, breaking the invariant that Ethereum-facing locations and local beneficiaries must not collide or resolve inconsistently, and leading to critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config`
- Entrypoint: `SnowbridgeSystemFrontend` signed bridge path from Asset Hub Polkadot
- Attacker controls: repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation
- Exploit idea: makes token-registration authority checks disagree between local-asset and foreign-asset ownership paths
- Invariant to test: Ethereum-facing locations and local beneficiaries must not collide or resolve inconsistently
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked foreign asset creation or credit
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
