# Q147: account-mapping collision via proxy proxy remote proxy on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a proof for a proxy definition that decodes but may map to a looser local `ProxyDefinition` than intended so that `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof` causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended, breaking the invariant that registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls, and leading to critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy_with_registered_proof`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy(... -> remote_proxy ...)` nesting a local proxy around the remote-proxy path
- Attacker controls: a proof for a proxy definition that decodes but may map to a looser local `ProxyDefinition` than intended
- Exploit idea: causes the wrong registered proof to be popped and consumed by a different wrapped call than the user intended
- Invariant to test: registered proofs must not be reusable, swappable, or consumable out of order across nested calls
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized privileged state transition through a replayed remote proof
- Fast validation: nested batch and multisig test asserting exactly which proof is popped and which call consumes it
