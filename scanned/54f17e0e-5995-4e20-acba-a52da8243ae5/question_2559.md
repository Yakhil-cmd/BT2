# Q2559: verify_blob_kzg_proof - evaluation shortcut soundness via Elixir [an-all-0xff-32-byte-string-2-255-non-can]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF` with an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof (helper: evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form)
- Entrypoint: bindings/elixir KZG.verify_blob_kzg_proof via ckzg_wrap.c NIF; the NIF derives counts from enif_get_list_length and fills a fixed-size int loop index
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: target the fr_equal shortcut branch during verification (an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical)).
- Invariant to test: shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a case in bindings/elixir/test/ckzg_test.exs asserting the invariant holds: shortcut result == the barycentric result for the same challenge (input: an all-0xFF 32-byte string (>= 2^255, non-canonical)).
