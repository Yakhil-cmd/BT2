# Q2288: wrong-asset bridge settlement via assetconversion create pool add on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset on Snowbridge runtime path and control repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation so that `snowbridge_pallet_system_frontend::Config` causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes, breaking the invariant that bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_system_frontend::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset
- Attacker controls: repeated or reordered bridge messages that race token registration, reserve assignment, and asset creation
- Exploit idea: causes the frontend swap or fee path to spend a different asset or amount than the bridge message assumes
- Invariant to test: bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: bridge integration test over register-token, send, and settle flows with asset identity assertions
