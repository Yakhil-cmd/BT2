# Q1020: pool-versus-staking split via nominationpools join bond extra on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config` makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to high - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes issuance, rewards, or held and reserved balances drift from what users can actually withdraw
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - unintended runtime behaviour with concrete user loss
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
