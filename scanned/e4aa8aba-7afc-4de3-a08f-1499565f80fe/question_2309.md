# Q2309: bridge-fee swap drift via assetconversion create pool add on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset on Snowbridge runtime path and control swap slippage and pool-state manipulation around fee conversion into the configured Ethereum fee asset so that `XcmMessageProcessor` makes the inbound converter create or reference the wrong foreign asset for a valid bridge payload, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `XcmMessageProcessor`
- Entrypoint: `AssetConversion::{create_pool, add_liquidity, swap_*}` when the frontend swaps into the fee asset
- Attacker controls: swap slippage and pool-state manipulation around fee conversion into the configured Ethereum fee asset
- Exploit idea: makes the inbound converter create or reference the wrong foreign asset for a valid bridge payload
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator plus bridge-queue test proving whether reorder or replay can break one-settlement invariants
