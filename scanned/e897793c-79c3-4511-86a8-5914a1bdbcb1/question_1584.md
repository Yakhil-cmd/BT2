# Q1584: subset via collateral-add: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) in a state where it push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? Given that it tests bitmask containment, the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-add` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `subset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
