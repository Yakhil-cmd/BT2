# Q4200: VerifyBlobKzgProofBatch - n==1 short-circuit divergence via CSharp [a-batch-whose-proofs-are-permuted-relati]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind)` with a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/csharp Ckzg.VerifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_wrap.c (used by Nethermind); the wrapper casts an int `numCells` to UInt64 and maps C_KZG_BADARGS to an ArgumentException
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: compare the n==1 path (delegates to verify_blob_kzg_proof) against the n>1 aggregation path on the same triple (a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
- Invariant to test: verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: an xUnit case in bindings/csharp Ckzg.Test/ReferenceTests.cs asserting the invariant holds: verify(...,1) == verify_blob_kzg_proof(same triple); the two paths never disagree (input: a batch whose proofs are permuted relative to the commitments).
