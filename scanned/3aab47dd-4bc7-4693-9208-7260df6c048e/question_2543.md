# Q2543: with_tx_channel_cap arithmetic overflows on reachable values (transmitter.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `with_tx_channel_cap` in `xdp/src/transmitter.rs` with a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance, and make the arithmetic in `with_tx_channel_cap` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/transmitter.rs` -> `with_tx_channel_cap()` (around line 95)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `with_tx_channel_cap` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `with_tx_channel_cap` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can craft stake, vote, or reward-distribution input that panics, overflows, or unboundedly expands work during epoch boundary processing and stalls every validator.
