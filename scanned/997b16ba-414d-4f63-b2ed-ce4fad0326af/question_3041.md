# Q3041: find-debt-scaled via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, drive `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt — to make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose, breaking the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
