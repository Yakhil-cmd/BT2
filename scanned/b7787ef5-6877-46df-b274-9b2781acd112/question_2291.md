# Q2291: Bypass proof binding

## Question
Can a malicious participant below threshold enter through `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` and control `identifiers`, `shares`, `point` so `eval_exponent_interpolation` accepts a `polynomial commitment` proof, commitment, or hash that is not bound to the exact sender/session/role context, leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/crypto/polynomials.rs::eval_exponent_interpolation`
- Entrypoint: `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `identifiers`, `shares`, `point`
- Exploit idea: Pair a proof/hash for one sender or session with a different `polynomial commitment` payload and see whether the binding check is incomplete.
- Invariant to test: Proofs, commitments, and hashes must be bound to the exact sender, session, and role they certify.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Construct a deterministic unit or invariant test around `crypto::polynomials::eval_exponent_interpolation` that feeds crafted `polynomial commitment` / `hash output` inputs, then assert whether downstream verification accepts an output that should have been rejected.
