# Q145: proof-stack confusion via utility batch all register on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])` on Asset-Hub remote proxy flow and control a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly so that `Pallet::remote_proxy` lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context, breaking the invariant that a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants, and leading to high - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `pallets/remote-proxy/src/lib.rs` :: `Pallet::remote_proxy`
- Entrypoint: `Utility::batch_all([register_remote_proxy_proof, remote_proxy_with_registered_proof])`
- Attacker controls: a `real` account whose local-to-remote mapping may collide or downgrade unexpectedly
- Exploit idea: lets a previously valid authorization be replayed across a changed remote or local security context
- Invariant to test: a remote proxy authorization must only dispatch the exact local privilege that the current remote proof grants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - critical call-path denial of service through proof-context corruption
- Fast validation: nested batch and multisig test asserting exactly which proof is popped and which call consumes it
