# Q2360: stake-reward desync via snowbridge settlement path that on Bridge reward payment logic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Snowbridge settlement path that triggers a relayer reward payout` on Bridge reward payment logic and control stake-lease timing and reward-claim ordering for the same relayer account so that `BridgeRewardPayer::pay_reward` routes a relayer reward to a different beneficiary type or destination than the runtime intended, breaking the invariant that one bridge reward must map to one beneficiary and one non-replayable payout result, and leading to critical - direct theft or misdirection of bridge relayer rewards?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_common_config.rs` :: `BridgeRewardPayer::pay_reward`
- Entrypoint: `Snowbridge settlement path that triggers a relayer reward payout`
- Attacker controls: stake-lease timing and reward-claim ordering for the same relayer account
- Exploit idea: routes a relayer reward to a different beneficiary type or destination than the runtime intended
- Invariant to test: one bridge reward must map to one beneficiary and one non-replayable payout result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft or misdirection of bridge relayer rewards
- Fast validation: fuzz test over versioned locations and payout resolution
