# Q4431: recoverCellsAndKzgProofs - recovered polynomial exceeds the degree bound via NodeJs [recovery-from-127-cells-a-single-missing]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/node.js kzg.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar)` with recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column), make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS so that a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip7594/eip7594.c :: recover_cells_and_kzg_proofs (helper: recover_cells)
- Entrypoint: bindings/node.js kzg.recoverCellsAndKzgProofs via kzg.cxx (used by Lodestar); get_cell_index() coerces a JS double to uint64 and returns 0 (still continuing) when the value is not a number
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column). Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: supply cells consistent on the given indices but not of degree < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB and see if recovery returns cells/proofs anyway (recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
- Invariant to test: recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a forged proof/commitment/cell verifies as valid, so unavailable or wrong blob data is accepted and finalized; consensus can be split (EF bug bounty, c-kzg-4844 in-scope crucial dependency).
- Fast validation: a jest case in bindings/node.js/test/kzg.test.ts asserting the invariant holds: recovered cells == the unique degree<4096 extension of the inputs, or C_KZG_BADARGS (input: recovery from 127 cells (a single missing column)).
