# Q582: fee-asset undercharge path via xcmpallet execute on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::execute` on Kusama Relay XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `SovereignAccountOf` makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does, breaking the invariant that delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: makes the barrier admit execution while the fee or asset path evaluates a different context than dispatch does
- Invariant to test: delivery, execution, and refund accounting must not let a user extract more value than was actually debited
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
