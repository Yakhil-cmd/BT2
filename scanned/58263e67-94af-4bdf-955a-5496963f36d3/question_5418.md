# Q5418: add-user-collateral via liquidate-redeem: push a third party's position past a fold bound so every e

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts? `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and push a third party's position past a fold bound so every evaluation of it aborts.
- Invariant to test: collateral leaving a borrower equals debt cleared scaled by the penalty, never more
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault whose share price the redemption moves across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `add-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
