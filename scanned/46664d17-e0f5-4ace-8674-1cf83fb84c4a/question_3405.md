# Q3405: coretime debit-allocation split via polkadotxcm execute on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::execute` on Coretime Kusama runtime and control batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded, breaking the invariant that signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution, and leading to high - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: batched proxy and multisig execution that changes broker state and then consumes the result immediately
- Exploit idea: lets a user replay or reorder a purchase, revenue, or assignment consequence after the first transition partially succeeded
- Invariant to test: signed users must not gain extra relay-side effects through batching or aliasing local execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - severe availability loss on the coretime purchase or assignment path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path depends on relay-side transact or burn messaging
