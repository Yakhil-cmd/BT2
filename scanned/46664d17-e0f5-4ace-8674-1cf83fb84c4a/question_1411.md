# Q1411: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via polkadotxcm teleport assets on Asset Hub Kusama XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets` on Asset Hub Kusama XCM and control an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message so that `AssetTransactors` reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `AssetTransactors`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::teleport_assets`
- Attacker controls: an asset set that mixes native, foreign, pooled, reserve-backed, or bridged representations in one message
- Exploit idea: reaches an exporter, alias, teleporter, or reserve path that should only be reachable from a tighter origin class
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or loss of bridged or transferred user funds
- Fast validation: differential test comparing origin/barrier resolution with the final dispatch origin and beneficiary
