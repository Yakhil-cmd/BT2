# Q3794: remote-payout beneficiary split via encointertreasuries signed payout or on Encointer remote treasury payout h

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways so that `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `fee_asset / ConstantKsmFee`
- Entrypoint: `EncointerTreasuries` signed payout or transfer path
- Attacker controls: asset kinds whose local and remote locations can be reanchored in multiple ways
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: local success state must never be reachable unless the remote transfer is uniquely bound and fully accounted for
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test over `get_remote_transfer_xcm`, emitted query state, and final beneficiary accounting
