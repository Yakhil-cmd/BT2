# Q0814: numeric overflow / negative length - FromFullNameWithHost in repo.go

## Question
Does `FromFullNameWithHost` in [internal/ghrepo/repo.go](internal/ghrepo/repo.go#L52) use a size/count/index from remote data in arithmetic or allocation without range checks?

## Target
- File/function: [internal/ghrepo/repo.go:52](internal/ghrepo/repo.go#L52) - `FromFullNameWithHost`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated command against attacker-influenced coordinates (gh api, gh pr list, gh repo view -R ...)
- Attacker controls: a repo/remote/host string or API response field the attacker publishes
- Exploit idea: Return a huge or negative numeric field.
- Invariant to test: Remote numerics are range-checked before allocation or slicing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Unbounded resource consumption on the victim's machine from a single attacker-published object
- Fast validation: Table test with extreme values asserting an error.
