# Q3413: coretime debit-allocation split via runtimecall broker signed user on Coretime Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path on Coretime Kusama runtime and control core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}` creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other, breaking the invariant that a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/coretime/coretime-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Broker, PolkadotXcm, Proxy, Utility}`
- Entrypoint: `RuntimeCall::Broker` signed user path
- Attacker controls: core allocation timing, revenue claim timing, and user-controlled credit or beneficiary state
- Exploit idea: creates a path where burn, revenue, or allocation bookkeeping is finalized in one subsystem but not the other
- Invariant to test: a user-triggered broker consequence must not be replayable after the underlying state changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds or purchased coretime
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that executes the signed broker path and compares local debit, relay-bound message, and final allocation state
