# Q979: proxy-batch privilege widening via nominationpools join bond extra on Kusama Relay runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}` on Kusama Relay runtime and control repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries so that `impl pallet_staking::Config` makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state, breaking the invariant that no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_staking::Config`
- Entrypoint: `NominationPools::{join, bond_extra, unbond, withdraw_unbonded, claim_payout}`
- Attacker controls: repeated user-triggered pool joins, exits, or payouts around reward and slash boundaries
- Exploit idea: makes two runtime subsystems disagree about the same user's balance, points, claimability, or unlocking state
- Invariant to test: no signed user can turn a normal call into a privileged or underpriced state change
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of user funds
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test if the path crosses the XCM pallet before returning to local state
