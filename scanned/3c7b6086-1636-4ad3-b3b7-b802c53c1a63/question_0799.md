# Q799: Swap participant ordering

## Question
Can a malicious network peer or malicious coordinator below threshold enter through `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)` with crafted `participants`, `wait`, `data`, `protocol message timing` and exploit `reliable_broadcast_send` so participant ordering or identifier mapping for `private channel` differs across nodes, breaking signer-set consistency and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: `src/protocol/echo_broadcast.rs::reliable_broadcast_send`
- Entrypoint: `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`
- Attacker controls: `participants`, `wait`, `data`, `protocol message timing`
- Exploit idea: Reorder or relabel participant-specific `private channel` values and look for divergent Lagrange or identifier handling.
- Invariant to test: Participant identifiers, ordering, and Lagrange weights must map 1:1 to the intended signer set.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: Run two or more local protocol instances around `Protocol::message(...)` during `keygen(...)`, `reshare(...)`, `refresh(...)`, `presign(...)`, `sign(...)`, or `ckd(...)`, let one malicious participant inject conflicting, replayed, or cross-context `private channel` data into `reliable_broadcast_send`, and assert whether honest nodes still accept a forged, leaked, or misbound output.
