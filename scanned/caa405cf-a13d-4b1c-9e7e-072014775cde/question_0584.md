# Q0584: unpack-u16 via liquidate-multi: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `unpack-u16` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
