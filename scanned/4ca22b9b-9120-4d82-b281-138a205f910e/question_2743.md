# Q2743: username-expiry accounting drift via proxy proxy utility batch on People Polkadot identity config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls on People Polkadot identity config and control identity metadata, username state, and sub-account deposit sizing around repeated set and clear operations so that `impl pallet_identity::Config` lets a user reclaim or avoid an identity-related deposit after the chain has already treated it as consumed, breaking the invariant that username and sub-account lifecycle state must not strand or duplicate user funds, and leading to critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/people.rs` :: `impl pallet_identity::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around identity-changing calls
- Attacker controls: identity metadata, username state, and sub-account deposit sizing around repeated set and clear operations
- Exploit idea: lets a user reclaim or avoid an identity-related deposit after the chain has already treated it as consumed
- Invariant to test: username and sub-account lifecycle state must not strand or duplicate user funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of user funds through bad refund or slash accounting
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over set_identity, set_subs, clear_identity, and username lifecycle boundaries
