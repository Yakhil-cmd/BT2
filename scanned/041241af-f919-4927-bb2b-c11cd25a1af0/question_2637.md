# Q2637: proxy-assisted identity escape via assets transfer transfer approved on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}` on People Polkadot runtime and control batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` reuses or reorders user-controlled identity state so a deposit, refund, or lock is consumed twice or never released, breaking the invariant that signed users must never reach registrar or admin-like effects through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Assets::{transfer, transfer_approved}`
- Attacker controls: batched updates that mutate both identity deposits and transferable balances before finalization
- Exploit idea: reuses or reorders user-controlled identity state so a deposit, refund, or lock is consumed twice or never released
- Invariant to test: signed users must never reach registrar or admin-like effects through batching, proxying, or XCM aliasing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds through misrouted refund, slash, or asset movement
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
