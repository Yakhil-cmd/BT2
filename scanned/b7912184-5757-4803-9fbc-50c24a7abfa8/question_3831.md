# Q3831: remote-transfer success drift via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer remote treasury payout helper

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout on Encointer remote treasury payout helper and control batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions so that `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm` causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid, breaking the invariant that query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable, and leading to critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/treasuries_xcm_payout.rs` :: `TransferOverXcm::get_remote_transfer_xcm`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around a remote treasury payout
- Attacker controls: batched treasury payouts that reuse the same source account and remote execution fee assumptions
- Exploit idea: causes the local payout logic and remote-transfer XCM to disagree about which beneficiary or asset is actually being paid
- Invariant to test: query and response state must not make a remote payout replayable or permanently unclaimable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of funds or duplicated treasury payout
- Fast validation: integration test that checks local success, remote execution result, and replay resistance together
