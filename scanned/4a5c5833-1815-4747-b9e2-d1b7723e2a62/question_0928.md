# Q0928: unwrap-status via liquidate: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `unwrap-status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111) in a state where it route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery? Given that it resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`, the invariant that a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:111` -> `unwrap-status`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `unwrap-status` resolves `status` with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `liquidate` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: a victim's outcome does not depend on whether an attacker transacted first in the same block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
