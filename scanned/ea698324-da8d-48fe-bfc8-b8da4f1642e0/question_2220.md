# Q2220: wrong-asset bridge settlement via ethereum originated bridge deposit on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot` on Snowbridge runtime path and control token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config` routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class, breaking the invariant that bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model, and leading to critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum-originated bridge deposit or withdraw flow processed by BridgeHubPolkadot and delivered into AssetHubPolkadot`
- Attacker controls: token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow
- Exploit idea: routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class
- Invariant to test: bridge registration and settlement must bind one asset identity to one backing asset and one authority model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct loss of bridged funds or wrong-asset unlock
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
