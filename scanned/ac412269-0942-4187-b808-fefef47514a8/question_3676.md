# Q3676: [nil / malformed signature split] `membership` action=`removed` -> MembershipHandler on a continuous_deployment enabled stack

## Question
Combining the `nil / malformed signature split` verification gap (attacker sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`) with a `membership` action=`removed` event against a victim stack where continuous_deployment enabled, can an unprivileged attacker make `MembershipHandler` (creates/finds a `Team` by `params.team.id` and a `User` by `params.member.login` then adds or removes the membership rows that `User#authorized?` reads) cause impact because the victim stack auto-ships newly-green commits via ContinuousDeliveryJob?

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shipit/webhooks_controller.rb + lib/shipit/github_app.rb + app/models/shipit/webhooks/handlers/membership_handler.rb
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated `POST /webhooks` (Shipit::WebhooksController#create)
- Attacker controls: the `membership` body action=`removed`, signature/headers; sends `X-Hub-Signature` with no `=` so `signature.split('=',2)` yields `algorithm` = whole string and `signature` = nil into `SecureCompare.secure_compare`; victim stack has continuous_deployment enabled
- Exploit idea: the comparison inputs are attacker-shaped and, for a no-secret org, never reached because verification short-circuits to true; `MembershipHandler` creates/finds a `Team` by `params.team.id` and a `User` by `params.member.login` then adds or removes the membership rows that `User#authorized?` reads; the victim stack auto-ships newly-green commits via ContinuousDeliveryJob amplifies the effect
- Invariant to test: A `membership` event only affects the repository/stack whose secret authenticated it, regardless of continuous_deployment enabled.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — Unauthorized deploy/rollback/merge of attacker-controlled code
- Fast validation: minitest: under `nil / malformed signature split`, forge `membership` action=`removed` for a continuous_deployment enabled stack, assert the downstream effect.
