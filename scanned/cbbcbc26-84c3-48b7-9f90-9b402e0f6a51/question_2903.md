# Q2903: proxy-assisted identity escape via polkadotxcm execute send on People Kusama runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}` on People Kusama runtime and control identity fields, username state, sub-account lists, and deposits packed into one signed flow so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended, breaking the invariant that a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of identity or asset balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-kusama/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `PolkadotXcm::{execute, send}`
- Attacker controls: identity fields, username state, sub-account lists, and deposits packed into one signed flow
- Exploit idea: makes identity deposits, slashes, or refunds settle to a different account or treasury destination than intended
- Invariant to test: a username, sub-account deposit, or identity lock must not be consumed twice or stranded forever
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of identity or asset balances
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
