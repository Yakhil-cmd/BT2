# Q1469: migration-balance drift via ahops unreserve lease deposit on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls so that `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}` causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects, breaking the invariant that staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `construct_runtime! / RuntimeCall::{Assets, ForeignAssets, PoolAssets, AssetConversion, AhOps, RemoteProxy, PolkadotXcm, NominationPools, Staking}`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}`
- Attacker controls: nested proxy, batch, multisig, and XCM composition around asset-moving calls
- Exploit idea: causes an asset move or swap path to settle with a different asset identity than the accounting path expects
- Invariant to test: staking, pool, and migration state must not let users withdraw the same economic value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
