# Q655: reserve-versus-teleport confusion via xcmpallet limited reserve transfer on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets` on Kusama Relay XCM and control an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls so that `SovereignAccountOf` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::limited_reserve_transfer_assets`
- Attacker controls: an XCM payload with attacker-chosen origin-shaping instructions, fee asset, beneficiary, and nested `Transact` calls
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: reserve-transfer, teleport, and exporter filters must not be bypassable with attacker-shaped message structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: xcm-emulator test that drives the exact signed or source-chain user path and asserts final origin plus asset balances
