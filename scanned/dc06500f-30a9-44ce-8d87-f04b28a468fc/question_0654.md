# Q654: origin-conversion mismatch via xcmpallet send on Kusama Relay XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `XcmPallet::send` on Kusama Relay XCM and control a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code so that `SovereignAccountOf` causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to high - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path?

## Target
- File/function: `relay/kusama/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `SovereignAccountOf`
- Entrypoint: `XcmPallet::send`
- Attacker controls: a location that can be interpreted differently across aliasing, account conversion, and asset transacting code
- Exploit idea: causes origin conversion to resolve a more privileged or different effective local origin than the barrier and fee path assume
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - stuck queue or persistent denial of service on a critical transfer path
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
