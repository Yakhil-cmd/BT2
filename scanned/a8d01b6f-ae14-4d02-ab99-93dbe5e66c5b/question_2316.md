# Q2316: wrong-asset bridge settlement via assethubpolkadot pallet xcm send on Snowbridge runtime path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation` on Snowbridge runtime path and control token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow so that `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config` routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class, breaking the invariant that inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets, and leading to critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bridge-hubs/bridge-hub-polkadot/src/bridge_to_ethereum_config.rs` :: `snowbridge_pallet_inbound_queue::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AssetHubPolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` targeting `SnowbridgeFrontendLocation`
- Attacker controls: token-registration parameters, beneficiary locations, and fee-asset routes controlled by the user-facing bridge flow
- Exploit idea: routes a user-controlled bridge call into an exporter or converter path that was intended for a different asset class
- Invariant to test: inbound and outbound bridge processing must not double-create, double-credit, or misroute foreign assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze or misdelivery of bridged assets
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over beneficiary, fee asset, and asset-location permutations
