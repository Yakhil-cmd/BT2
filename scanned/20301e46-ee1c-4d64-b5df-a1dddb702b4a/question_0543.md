# Q0543: calc-treasury-lp-preview via redeem: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
`calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `recipient`, use that to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, violating the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `redeem` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-treasury-lp-preview` touches, run `redeem` with `recipient`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
