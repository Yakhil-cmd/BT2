# Q3712: total-supply-preview via redeem: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) in a state where it reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? Given that it adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `redeem` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
