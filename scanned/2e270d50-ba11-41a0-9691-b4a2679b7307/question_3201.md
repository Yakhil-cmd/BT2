# Q3201: CRC21 source send lock under amount boundary atomicity

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public send_to_ibc(string,uint,uint,bytes) by controlling recipient, amount, channel_id, extraData, isSource and allowance when the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid, then emit IBC send event for source token without exact module_address lock so that source sends lock exactly amount before native IBC transfer fails and no partial native, EVM, IBC, or token state can commit on an error path, leading to Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/src/ModuleCRC21.sol::send_to_ibc
- Entrypoint: public send_to_ibc(string,uint,uint,bytes)
- Attacker controls: recipient, amount, channel_id, extraData, isSource and allowance; scenario focus: amount boundary plus atomicity.
- Exploit idea: emit IBC send event for source token without exact module_address lock while the attacker uses smallest, dust, and near-limit amounts that remain syntactically valid.
- Invariant to test: source sends lock exactly amount before native IBC transfer; also verify no partial native, EVM, IBC, or token state can commit on an error path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds through Cronos blockchain/app code.
- Fast validation: build a local integration test with two accounts and compare state root plus balances before and after the attempted flow. Scoped to live HackenProof Cronos Blockchain Protocols: cryptographic flaws and vulnerabilities causing unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds; excludes DoS/DDoS/spam, gas draining, leaked keys, privileged-address/admin abuse, basic governance attacks, known fork/dependency issues without a working Cronos PoC, tests, mocks, scripts, docs, disabled configs, and non-production code.
