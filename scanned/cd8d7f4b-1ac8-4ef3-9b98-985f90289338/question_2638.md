# Q2638: sub-account lock reuse via identity set identity clear on People Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}` on People Polkadot runtime and control asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds, breaking the invariant that identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries, and leading to critical - permanent freeze of identity or asset balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Identity::{set_identity, clear_identity, set_subs, request_judgement}`
- Attacker controls: asset transfers, proxy calls, and XCM execution bundled around identity lifecycle operations
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, multisig, or XCM execution observe a different account state than the identity logic uses for charges or refunds
- Invariant to test: identity slashing and treasury routing must not leak funds to attacker-chosen beneficiaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freeze of identity or asset balances
- Fast validation: runtime integration test around identity set, clear, sub-account, and refund sequencing
