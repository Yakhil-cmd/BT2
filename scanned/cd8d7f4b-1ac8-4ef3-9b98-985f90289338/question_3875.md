# Q3875: fee-asset undercharge path via bulletinpolkadot pallet xcm execute on Bulletin Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BulletinPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute` on Bulletin Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `Barrier` forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another, breaking the invariant that location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/bulletin/bulletin-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `Barrier`
- Entrypoint: `BulletinPolkadot::pallet_xcm::execute`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: forces the runtime to treat the same asset as local in one step and foreign, reserve-backed, or bridged in another
- Invariant to test: location-to-account conversion must stay injective enough for all accepted user and XCM flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
