# Q3554: cross-ceremony state bleed via proxy proxy utility batch on Encointer runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around Encointer calls on Encointer runtime and control XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows so that `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs` causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption, breaking the invariant that community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows, and leading to critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/encointer/src/lib.rs` :: `impl_runtime_apis! / XCM payment and dry-run APIs`
- Entrypoint: `Proxy::proxy` / `Utility::batch_all` around Encointer calls
- Attacker controls: XCM or proxy execution layered around community payout or reputation-consuming flows
- Exploit idea: causes a payout, faucet action, or bazaar settlement to finalize locally without the matching burn, hold, or reputation consumption
- Invariant to test: community treasury and issued balances must always reconcile after user-triggered flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked or duplicated community balances
- Fast validation: runtime integration test over the exact community, ceremony, and payout sequence with balance and reputation assertions
