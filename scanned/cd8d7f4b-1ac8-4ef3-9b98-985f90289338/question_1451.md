# Q1451: proxy-batched asset escape via ahops unreserve lease deposit on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}` on Asset Hub Polkadot runtime and control proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement so that `impl pallet_assets::Config` makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path, breaking the invariant that fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits, and leading to critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs` :: `impl pallet_assets::Config`
- Entrypoint: `AhOps::{unreserve_lease_deposit, withdraw_crowdloan_contribution, unreserve_crowdloan_reserve, transfer_to_post_migration_treasury}`
- Attacker controls: proofs, remote account mappings, and wrapped calls that end in asset movement
- Exploit idea: makes proxy, XCM, or batched execution bypass the intended restrictions of the underlying asset or staking path
- Invariant to test: fees, refunds, and swapped amounts must reconcile with the final debits and credits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized withdrawal, unlock, or treasury-affecting transfer
- Fast validation: runtime integration test that compares debit, credit, issuance, and beneficiary state across all touched pallets
