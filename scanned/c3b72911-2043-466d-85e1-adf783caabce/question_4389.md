# Q4389: write-feed via liquidate: seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its o

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) — which applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status — to seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against, breaking the invariant that a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `liquidate` and seize from a position that is solvent under the mask its own operations were validated against.
- Invariant to test: a position can always be enumerated, priced, liquidated and withdrawn from whatever state others created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `write-feed` touches, run `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
