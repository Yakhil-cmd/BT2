# Q4248: accrue-and-cache via supply-collateral-add: make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency gro

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) in a state where it make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose? Given that it keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, the invariant that the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a victim's position resolve to a worse efficiency group than it chose.
- Invariant to test: the only writes to a third party's position are a correct liquidation and a debt-reducing repayment
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `accrue-and-cache` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
