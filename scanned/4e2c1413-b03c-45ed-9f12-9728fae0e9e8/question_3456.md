# Q3456: verifyBlobKzgProofBatch - affine-compress vs bytes_from_g1 in the transcript via Java [a-compressed-point-with-the-sign-y-bit-f]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, calling `bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku)` with a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped, make c-kzg-4844 break the invariant that transcript point bytes == the canonical commitment/proof encoding used elsewhere so that this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference?

## Target
- File/function: src/eip4844/eip4844.c :: verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch (helper: compute_r_powers_for_verify_kzg_proof_batch)
- Entrypoint: bindings/java CKZG4844JNI.verifyBlobKzgProofBatch via ckzg_jni.c (used by Besu/Teku); the JNI layer trusts a jlong `count` cast to size_t and only checks GetArrayLength == count*BYTES_PER_*
- Attacker controls: attacker-published bytes: a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped. Delivered as a blob transaction / blob sidecar / data-column sidecar and forwarded unchanged by honest nodes.
- Exploit idea: check blst_p1_affine_compress used for the transcript equals bytes_from_g1 for every point incl. infinity (a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped).
- Invariant to test: transcript point bytes == the canonical commitment/proof encoding used elsewhere.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - this library's verdict or output bytes diverge from the reference (Constantine / Rust-Eth-KZG), forking nodes that run different clients (>1/3 split territory).
- Fast validation: a JUnit case in bindings/java CKZG4844JNITest asserting the invariant holds: transcript point bytes == the canonical commitment/proof encoding used elsewhere (input: a compressed point with the sign/y-bit flipped).
