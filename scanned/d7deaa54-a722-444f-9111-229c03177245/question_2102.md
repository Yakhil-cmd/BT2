# Q2102: find-and-resolve-asset-value via collateral-remove: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call? `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found, so the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) varied, and assert that the value `find-and-resolve-asset-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
