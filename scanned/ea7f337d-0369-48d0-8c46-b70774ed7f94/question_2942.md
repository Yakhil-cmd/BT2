# Q2942: lookup via collateral-add: reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transa

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it? `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration, so the invariant that no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reprice every other holder's collateral in the same transaction that profits from it.
- Invariant to test: no transaction by one principal changes what another can withdraw beyond the pool economics the protocol implements
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) varied, and assert that the value `lookup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
