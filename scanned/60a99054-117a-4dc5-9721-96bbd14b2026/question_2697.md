# Q2697: alias collision on execution via peoplepolkadot pallet xcm send on People Polkadot XCM

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::send` on People Polkadot XCM and control topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows so that `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin` makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary, breaking the invariant that signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution, and leading to critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `system-parachains/people/people-polkadot/src/xcm_config.rs` :: `XcmOriginToTransactDispatchOrigin`
- Entrypoint: `PeoplePolkadot::pallet_xcm::send`
- Attacker controls: topic, query, and beneficiary fields that are replayed or reordered across otherwise valid XCM flows
- Exploit idea: makes pre-dispatch fee estimation and final withdrawal disagree on the effective asset, payer, or beneficiary
- Invariant to test: signed users and user-controlled remote messages must never obtain Root, system-parachain, relay, or privileged plurality execution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorized local execution with direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: stateful fuzz test over location, asset, and beneficiary permutations with assertions on issuance and backing
