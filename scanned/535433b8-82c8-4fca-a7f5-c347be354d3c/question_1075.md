# Q1075: get_stack confuses account types or owners (mem_pool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_stack` in `program-runtime/src/mem_pool.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and have `get_stack` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_stack` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/mem_pool.rs` -> `get_stack()` (around line 125)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_stack` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_stack` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_stack` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can move, withdraw, split, merge, or redelegate lamports from a system, stake, or vote account whose authority key they do not hold.
