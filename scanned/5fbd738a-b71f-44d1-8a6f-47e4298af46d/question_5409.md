# Q5409: next-index via repay: route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) — which returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting — to route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `repay` and route a victim's mandatory payout through a principal that always rejects delivery.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-index` touches, run `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
