# Q5821: interest-rate via supply-collateral-add: write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call, breaking the invariant that one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and write a stranger's ledger through an unsolicited on-behalf-of call.
- Invariant to test: one borrower's loss is not charged to suppliers beyond the socialization the design intends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `interest-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
